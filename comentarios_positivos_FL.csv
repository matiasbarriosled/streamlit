"He's a knowledgeable doctor but the way he runs his office is a mess.  I referred a lot of people to them and wish now that I hadn't.

For instance, they once called me an hour before an appointment and cancelled.  Also, they don't do their referrals correctly and just overall seem to hold their patients in low esteem.

Here's an example, I called his office last week with severe back pains and they said it would be 3 weeks before he could see me - that I should go to Urgent Care.  I then called my former doctor and he said come on over - we'll get to you.  That's the difference and that's what you should look for in a PCP.

Revised 07/16/20.  I'm revising this review to a ""5"" because, as I said before, he's a knowledgeable doctor - superb actually.

I've heard that all the office personnel and nurse practitioner have been changed or reassigned.  If so, it would be unfair to him to leave a poor rating when they seemed to be the main problem."
"Best doctor I've ever had, I never wait to be evseen, he's very understanding to my needs and only wants to help me any way he can, I would recommend this doctor too every one I know."
Takes the time to actually get to know his patients. Very good doctor and honest
Very good doctor

"One of the best, if not the best, Doctor my boys have seen... very courteous staff and are great with the kids!!! Both offices are 100% recommended!!!"
The Best Kay is one in a million. Everyone in this office is excellent don‚Äôt let the comment of one or two people sway you. If you can‚Äôt laugh and talk at work it‚Äôs no fun.
One of the best pediatricians in Bradenton. We always get fast appointments same day when our child is sick.
"Good
Exelent service.
God Bless"
I've raised 5 children through the care of this office! Dr. Frias and his entire staff are so wonderful! We've been going to both of his offices since 2007. Way back then is when the practice was starting! He still has most of his original staff working there which makes it so comfortable taking my children and my permanent guardian children who were abused there to see any doctor or physician assistants he has and staff and are available to see them. Due to years of going and seeing the same faces in this office years later is very heart warming to me being a mom of a 22 year old girl who was a patient until 19. A 17 year old girl who is very shy is very comfortable tgere.and a 14 year old boy as well and hes alot like his sister. Just when I thought I'd never have kids again God put 2 little Angel's in our hands to care and with the help of APC Pediatrics they are very different children now. Their fears are gone and they are loved! Not just by me but by the entire staff in both offices who know the Aguilars ;-) Highly recommended! Dont go off of comments below from disgruntled parents who have no clue what it takes to run 2 offices at this caliber and still love and care for their current patients!!
They are the best!!

"I have been ordering from them every week for about seven years! It Is like Christmas every week. Beautiful fruits and veggies! I use their foods to feed my entire family. People, dogs, cat, ducks....They have specials all the time online. They have fresh local honey. Different herbs at different times of the year. Fresh chickens. Fresh eggs. Micro Greens. Jams. Cider.

The company really works hard with their hospitality, if there‚Äôs ever a problem, you call or email them and they fix it right a way. You cannot go wrong with this company. There really is nothing better than fresh foods, homegrown and delivered to your house. You guys are amazing! Thank you! The Barrellas"

The service was excellent, I had a short term rental property with another property management company and they always had an excuse as to why my maintenance costs where so high.

Holly is Awesome and I have been her client for about 15 years!!!
The ladies that work here are very welcoming and willing to help you find what you need. I came in with an old lipstick container. The sales associate was spot on and she took time to help me find a new color.
"I get my eyebrows done here amazing!!! finally found a place to do them right and they only cost $8.00 they are quick, you could book appoiments and are open on Sundays."
My favorite hair stylist is Holly she came from another salon and I really like Lofts. I've followed Holly for over 20 years she the best.

"Fabulous cut! I recently went here and saw Consuela (I hope I‚Äôve spelled correctly) after my mother recommended this shop & I love my new haircut! I wanted shorter but stylish and she did an awesome job building in texture. The price for my shampoo, cut, and blow dry/style was much less than I‚Äôve paid at other salons yet I‚Äôm much happier with this cut. Many of the staff also speak Spanish and the outside sign advertises ‚ÄúDominican style‚Äù, but they are skilled in all hair types/styles. I will definitely be returning üíõ"
Absolutely AMAZING service! The staff was amazing friendly and very helpful with helping me choose what i wanted! And it turned out beautiful! Everyone stops to ask where it was done at and im very quick to tell them Kelly's Hair Salon in Riverview!!
"Best salon ever! I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of this salon. Every stylist here is very talented, and the service is impeccable. You will not be disappointed. I came in with my daughter and they are the definition of perfection when it comes to haircutting and coloring. Amazing!!!"
The hairc last longer great products and excelent customer service.
Consuelo is amazing great service!
The best hair salon in Riverview. Great prices and very professional. Consuelo is an expert doing colors. Love it.

"Great staff, very helpful."
Never had many problems with them.  Even when inhave they have fixed the issue.
Best branch ever!!!
Very helpful staff
"Great attitude and excellent pricing!
We extended the rental probably 6 times and every time was easy and pleasant!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
Awesome storage facility and very nice and helpful staff. We highly recommend this storage facility for their fair prices- never went up during the years of our storage there- upgrades in their facility- AC and fans and security features. Their staff changed quite a bit but they seemed to improve. We also got a Ubox and the staff were very helpful when we encountered issues with it. My Dad has rented trailers from here and he had a similar experience with the staff going out of their way to help him. We would definitely recommend using this facility and their services for any and all your needs.
"Awesome experience in moving and glad I did over movers. Prices were right on par. Don't expect them to answer the phone. In case anyone is wondering, there is a dumpster out back if you need to through away something you forgot in the back."
"I've done a lot of business with them and have had no problem.  Mostly I rent vans.  The only problem is they can be a little slow if there are a lot of people there, but otherwise they are fine."
The guys were very friendly and helpful and we were in and out! Would definitely use again or recommend for anyone moving!!!
Great prices and convenient but service was very slow when returning the truck
Courteous staff. Answered all my questions and helped figure out how many moving supplies I needed!
I use them pretty often.  Rarely have an issue.

I love Dr Kolettis. He has a great bedside manner. His staff are very personable and get right back to you.  I recently had knee surgery and he took pictures for me! He really listens to people.  Highly recommend!
"I work in Healthcare and I have been a patient at Boca Orthopedics intermittently. Every staff member and provider makes each visit a personal, professional experience and customer service is top notch. Dr Kolettis exceeded every expectation."
A very compassionate and caring doctor
"Dr. Kolettis is extremely talented. Aside from his god given talent, he is very patient, kind, and gentle. Most importantly, he will treat your medical issue and the leave you with the best possible results in America."
"I'd give him 10 STARS if I could! Dr. Kolettis is,, by far, one of the best surgeons that I've ever had... and I've had quite a few of them. His bedside manner surpasses any doctor that I've ever met. He is very patient and takes the time to explain things to you both pre- and post-op. It's obvious that he genuinely cares about his patients. I highly recommend him for rotator cuff repair surgery!!!"
"I went to Dr. Kolettis with knee pain. He diagnosed Osteo Arthritis. I was hoping for a fix that could be permanent. Just not in my near future. He referred me to Bolduc Physical Therapists who have helped me gain strength in my knee and walk near normal again. I am very happy with the practices office, administration and nursing staff. They are warm, welcoming and helpful.  I highly recommend Dr. George Kolettis and the Boca Raton Orthopedic Group."
Where has this gem of a physician been hiding?  Best bedside manner of any physician I've had in Florida.
Best doctor ever. Extremely knowledgeable and great personal bedside manner. Dr Kolettis takes time with you and makes you feel you are his only patient. Very genuine  He listens to you.
"Good doctor ..helped my mother through difficult times.
Really cares about his patients. thank you again for all your help"

Fantastic crew!  The owner of the business was very kind on the phone.  They could schedule within a few days.  The report was a tremendous help and included pictures and details for home improvements.  I am very happy with the value and the time spent on the property.  I would highly recommend!!!
"I have used this company twice so far, and both times they have come through for me on a home inspection. My first one was done by David Gibbs; my second done by Paul Roberts. You could not ask for a more thorough inspection company with inspectors who take the time to answer all of your questions, show, and explain to you areas of concern and how to improve them so that each aspect of your home can reach its full lifespan. Pro 1 is worth every penny, every time. Thank you so much for two jobs done well!"
"Scott did an excellent job inspecting my future home.  His report was very thorough, yet explained everything in a way that a first-time homebuyer could understand.  I especially appreciated the pictures from the nooks and crannies in the attic, with arrows added in so that my untrained eye could understand the problem areas he was referring to.  Will definitely use him if I ever buy more property; I'd also recommend his firm to friends/family."
"Scott went through the house, giving honest feedback to us. We have used him twice. He found a major issue in the first house that stopped us from making a major mistake. The second house he found a few minor things. He knows his stuff. I would trust him and I would recommend him. Also Dennis was great to work with, very friendly and thorough. A business with integrity."
Scott is great. He does a great job. He is very knowledgeable and detailed.
"Got my best friend from there, as soon as I can get some land I will go back and get a girfriend for my buddy! Great people, my dog is awesome!"
"We met the perfect Rotty today. We felt, as well as the staff at the Rotty Rescue, that it was important to not make a rushed decision. Joe and Brenda spent a lot of time screening me and my family to make sure our new Rottie, Angie, would have a safe and loving home.

My whole family and my dog had to come to the ranch to meet Angie. Joe introduced all of us slowly, as he knew my number one concern when finding a Rotty was the safety of my children and my bulldog puppy. Joe had at least 25 Rottweilers that I could see, but based on our needs he thought Angie would be a great fit. He and Brenda did a great job. I can tell that they would not hesitate to remove an adopted Rottie from an unsafe environment, which shows me that they really care."
What a great place for these gental giants! Adopt a Rottie!!!!!
Joe and his staff are very great and love all the dogs!!!
Got my Brandi from them. Great rescue!
Dog rescue with a heart.
Love the work Joe is doing with the dogs.

Our friends have stayed here for 8 years in a row. we love to go and visit! It is always clean and a welcoming atmosphere. if you haven't stayed I would recommend you give this place a try! amazing family atmosphere
"My husband and I were just about to get married down here in Florida. We had lots of family in the area, and our original plans didn‚Äôt go according to plan, but it worked out great. I called Steve, and he helped us out majorly. We stayed for a month, and this is a simple rv park, which is all we wanted and needed. Had sewer connections which was super important to us, and the rv park itself is woodsy. It‚Äôs a bit rustic, but we didn‚Äôt want or need all the ‚Äúextras‚Äù. It‚Äôs close to the beach, and the places we needed to be. But what really made this park was Steve. You could tell he truly cared about the guests here. He‚Äôs honest and a good man. We will definitely be back when we come down to Florida. Thank you for all your help Steve!!!"
We've been here for two nights so far and we love! It's dog friendly and not far from fishing! And very private. I would recommend it to anyone.
"Very simple RV park full of trees and shade. No pool, game room, or anything like that, but the quiet is wonderful. Listen to all manner of creatures at night. Nice owners. No night time artificial light. This is like a State Park without all the rules. I highly recommend Fay's for an alternative to the the manicured concrete covered ""corporate"" RV parks."
Super place to stay!

Rich DeNezza was amazing! Super friendly and got us in and out in less than an hour. Explained everything clearly and in detail. He really made our appointment and apartment hunting easy.
Rich was great made us feel comfortable and got us approved in a speedy process in the same day. Rich is great ask for him if you are looking he's the guy!
I recently moved into this neighborhood and I must say the leasing agent Rich has been more than accommodating. The ease of paperwork and any and all issues with the unit he has dressed and fixed promptly. The neighborhood is friendly and well maintained. I look forward to my stay at Heronwood apartments.
"Well I would like to say this was the best and fastest move in without any delemas. Rich definitely made me feel like a priority and stayed in contact with me all the way to the end of move in.I would come to the office and if I needed help with something rich helped me. I knew from the beginning when I first spoke with rich that this was gonna be home. Now I am a army veteran and I was homeless and rich made me feel that there was hope and I wouldn't be homeless anymore. He was right, and his level of care towards people was right on.I am here because of him and his persistence. If your looking to move and you are having problems,just come to see rich.You won't be disappointed and I'm very happy with Heronwood apartments.Once again thank you."
"Rich DeNezza is absolutely the best leasing agent in SWFL, he made the application and pre-move in process quick and easy!!! Thank you Rich! Counting down the days until I move in!!"
"The new management has done a really great job cleaning up the property, it's never looked better!  The management is also quite friendly and helpful."

Did an amazing job. My car looks and smells great. The communication was easy and the guys were professional and on time.
Nick does our whole fleet! Wouldn't trust anyone else! Great work :)
Nick does an amazing job. My loops like new every time. I wouldn't trust anyone else to clean my car. Thanks Nick!
"Nick takes care of my truck every couple weeks and it always looks better than the day I brought it home from the dealership.

Would definitely recommend to anyone needing a quick wash or thorough cleaning!!!"
"Always, always, always a great job! Their attention to the littlest of details is what sets them apart."
Nick is more than amazing! He's detail oriented and professional!
Great place to get your car washed.

"I went to a local barbershop who didn't cut my hair correctly. I passed by here, I met Tony one of the barbers here. He restore my head from the previous cut I received elsewhere.Since then I visit regularly to this location"
"These barbers are very efficient friendly environment very professional and very important the best haircuts in the city! They will not take your edge back instead complementing  what your hair is like. If Ray goes to the North Pole I'll be here waiting until he returns, I don't trust any other barber shop!"
Awesome service and very professional. Nice atmosphere that you just relax and be engage with the barber's and other customers.
My daughter tried everything with her hair.. Until here thank you Mrs. Helen for such a great job
Ray is one of the top barber's in St.Pete.

Ursula is fantastic. I just picked up three items and they look wonderful. I've been using her services for about 6 years (probably 10+ items total) and she's always easy to communicate with. Her quality is wonderful and prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend.
"Wonderful, classy, welcoming, prompt! The week is top notch for a real world budget. I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Ursula's by accident because she is local. I needed last minute wedding dress alterations the week before my wedding and was panicking a little bit. They were SO SWEET and super fast!! My dress was done early and it was PERFECT!!! I didn't get quotes from anyone else but compared to what I googled for basic wedding dress alterations, way less expensive! When I was in here, there was numbers customers in and out, you could tell they were loyal repeat business. That is always reassuring to see when you have just trusted someone too cut and change your wedding dress! I will be telling everyone about Ursula's and definitely returning if I need anything else done."
"Excellent work, competed as scheduled, and courteous service."
I had an issue with a zipper on a backpack and I brought it in. It was literally fixed within 1 minute and I wasn't charged for anything. This is real customer service. 5 stars
"I went to Ursula to have my wedding dress altered based on a friend's recommendation. From the moment I met her, she was just fantastic!! She intuitively knew exactly what I wanted and how to make my dress even more stunning! She was honest, friendly and patient with me right from the beginning. I even had all my bridesmaid's dresses altered with her. Not only were all of our dresses perfect, the cost was significantly less expensive than if we'd gone anywhere else! I'll 100% be seeing her in the future for all of my alterations!"
Came in on short notice to get a suit tailored for a wedding in Italy. Ursula was perfect. Best fitting clothes I've ever worn. I highly recommend this store! Great turn around time. Super professional. She is the real deal.
Awesome best in the Berg. For sure Rock on Ursula.
I went in to get my bridesmaid dress fitted and altered. But then 3 months later I ended up pregnant and she had to take the dress out and I have no idea how she did it but it was absolutely perfect and no one had a clue.
"Excellent work, wonderful service"
"Very costly, but good work. I was only disappointed  one time out of several times of going here."
Attractive lady helped me with my jeans. Reasonable price and amount of time.
"Very reasonable, friendly and fast in my repair of pants."
"Good prices and personable staff, the only down side is that they are always busy and may not be able to get your alterations done right away."
The best seamstress around always perfect polite and professional. I love Ursula...
Excellent work. Quick service!

This place is truly unique! I love that you‚Äôre allowed to bring dogs into the boutique and there is always different styles of clothing to suit everyone. I‚Äôm a little small so most of the items I tried on didn‚Äôt fit me but I love that this place is unique and has some of the most beautiful items. The owner is nice and it seems to always stay on trend with quality pieces!
This place has the most comfortable couch for boyfriends/husbands to wait on. Makes shopping with the lady even more of a pleasure. 5 stars
"You can always find something in here. They have great tastes in their curation of the store. It is better for women than men, but that's no surprise.
Great sunglasses collection as well."
"Stylish appareal, owner is local but has intetnational taste.  Have known him for years.  Great adddition to the diversity of the 5 points shops and community."
"good place for troubled youths. Picked up my now 17 tear old from discharge.
This place worked with him very hard because he wasn't cooperating. We are hoping that he has changed."

"It saddens me to see so many bad reviews about Daniel especially when it does not depict what programs are being specified. I can not speak for Daniel residential as I have not had to use it however I have used their counseling program for my son and he had some amazing therapists that really helped us along the way.  My son has Aspergers, ADHD and severe dyslexia, he began attending Daniel in 1st grade, his behaviors were so bad, he was off the wall and no other school would take him. I felt helpless until DANIEL ACADEMY. My son was given a chance that no other school would give him and I am so thankful for Daniel everyday. My boy attended this school from 1st to 5th grade, I was content in keeping him there because they have been so good to us, but the principal was upfront with me and told me that it was time for him to find a place that suited him better. My boy made leaps and bounds at this school, so much to the point that he no longer needed to be there, while the school could have kept him there and kept the money they were receiving for him they cared more about my boy and his future success.
Let me be clear, this school works with children of all different behaviors and disabilities, it is a HARD job, it is exhausting. The amount of mental anguish these teachers take home with them everyday as a result of trying to help our babies is immense. Yet they come back everyday, with smiles on their faces ready to get through the day and battle the enormous trials that each day holds. If you have not had to experience this or witness this first hand then I would urge you to do research because the work that these teachers do everyday is uncomprehensible compared to what most of us experience at our own places of employment. Thank you Daniel Academy for being what my son needed, for being there for him and fighting for him!"
"Exceptional school that provides quality education! This is my son's first year here, and he has excelled in ways in which he never has in his entire school career. The principal & staff are absolutely phenomenal!!!! I would highly recommend this school to any family in need of a nurturing, student focused, controlled learning environment such as Daniel Academy."
Great place for kids working with life's difficulties.
"Friendly staff, no wait times, great programs for kids."

"Honestly, where do I start? My now finance purposed to me on July 4th and when my eyes first met with the diamond I was blown away. The ring was perfect. The clarity of the diamond, the cut and the design of the ring was breathe taking. Also, it was elegant, and it fit perfectly. I have never stepped foot into this establishment but if the jewelers can bring my vision to life without even speaking to me is priceless. Thank you, Elements Jewelry Studio, for making my special day even more perfect with you high quality diamond rings."
Aaron and Jennifer are wonderful! They took my heirloom diamonds and created a beautiful pair of earrings for my daughter for her wedding. They were stunning. I‚Äôll be in soon to share pictures : ).  R.Johnson
"They quickly allowed me in, graciously treated me like a guest, was very hospitable and kind.  Thanks Joe"
"I could hardly be any happier with Aaron and Jen-owners of Elements Jewelry Studio. They are both amazingly talented jewelers, they‚Äôre conscientious in their work. I‚Äôve always been made to feel like my business is valued and appreciated. Look at this magnificent ring-revitalized! Thank you!"
"Comfortable, inviting atmosphere, excellent customer service. This store does it all, from sells out of the cases, repairs, to design and in house casting. A true working studio. Go in and enjoy a no pressure buying experience. They are all about the highest quality of any piece they make or sell and will work within your budget. And if you love dogs, there is always at least one or two hanging out in the store, and if you are lucky enough you will be able to love on themüòä"
"Aaron and Jennifer are amazing! I wanted a custom ring. The jewelry shops in St Johns town center  quoted the same ring for about $1,500, and here it was only $1,000. It was a very unusual design, and it was hard to make. They did it and it is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend them!"
Aaron and Jen are an awesome couple running this shop. So knowledgeable and very quick turnover with projects. I keep coming back for more!
"The best place in Jax for jewelry! Have you ever walked into other jewelry stores and felt like you were judged on your looks or style? Not here!! The owners are so personable and truly care about their customers, providing one of a kind artwork. Don't go anywhere else for your jewelry. Visit them for a one of a kind jewelry shopping experience!"
"Got a ring resized here a while back. Fantastic service and the gentleman that resized my ring really seems to know his stuff. Would definitely recommend this place. They're great here,"
Very nice selection.  Jewelry repair right on site by Master jeweler.
Great place for custom jewelry!

"Went in for western medicine came out with a taste of eastern medicine. What a great idea to place a drink bar in a pharmacy, a place you normally don't expect to enjoy yet you can get a refreshing tea or coffee while you wait or for the road (although I enjoyed my experience at the pharmacy too, see my other review). I got a strawberry green tea with Boba and it was amazing. Refreshing, great tasting, crafted by great customer service. I recommend this place!"
"This place is truly unique! I love how curated and simplistic each menu item is. I got the OTW to the Beach with tapioca pearls and I was fairly impressed. Not only was it fresh, but it was delicious as well.

Although I wish this place opened longer, I think they carefully craft each drink to perfection. My drink had strawberries and a tea base which mixed together, tasted like a refresher. I was also pleasantly surprised by the passion fruit fruit tea which tasted like it came straight from the fruit itself. It had a concentrated flavor and a slight tang to it. The peach green tea was delicious as well but you can taste more green tea than actual peach.

The menu has interesting items and I can‚Äôt wait to come back to try the Yuzu Dream. If they had some sort of description on their menu of what was contained in each drink, I feel like it would have appealed more to customers. Other than that, the atmosphere and dining area is comfortable. They also sell cakes and desserts which look heavenly. I hope to come back soon but I recommend this mom & daughter shop! They share the building with a joint pharmacy so the early closing time is understandable. The staff was accommodating and helpful as well!"
"Service was great. Staff behind the counter was patient and friendly. Order was filled quickly. One star removed because they ran out of Boba. I ordered 3 different drinks. The teas tasted fresh. Sweetness was balanced. I plan on visiting again to try other drinks.
This location is literally a counter in a shared space with a pharmacy.
Parking outside is limited to 8 parking spaces."
"Delicious and refreshing. I'm not able to go as frequently as I would like (daily would be ideal) but wow, every time I get a drink from here it does not disappoint. My favorite is the passion fruit milk tea, which is so far beyond any similar drink I've had elsewhere (in fact when I've ordered it elsewhere I've only been disappointed by the comparison). The limeaid is super refreshing, and the iced coffees are also delicious and don't need anything added. Staff are always nice and friendly, the snacks look delicious but I haven't gotten any yet. I can't recommend this place enough."
"Totally awesome experience, the plus is that there is a pharmacy and a lounge. I just might visit again soon. PS my muffin was so fresh."
"Incredible! The coffee was perfectly made, and the peach cake was so yummy! Definitely recommend!"
"I really enjoyed the yuzu dream, it's really refreshing."
"Great coffee, great tea, great prices. New stop for my coffee."

The salads were lackluster though with well written descriptions that made them hard to pass by...kudos to the menu editor! The apps and entrees were all fantastic! The grouper was fabulous and the chowder was not to be missed.   Oysters Rockefeller were fantastic once the stale crackers had been swapped out.  Great meal though pricey.

I'll avoid at all costs going to the Main Post office again."

We finally found a place we trust with our vehicles.   Owner is very responsive and reasonable and actually listens.  This is the only place we will go to from now on.  Highly recommend!!
700 miles from home and my truck would not change gears.  I found Blast online and took it there and was not disappointed.  Cyrus and his staff diagnosed the problem and repaired it at a fair cost.  Drove back home with no problems.  Thank you Blast for helping make our vacation great.
Awesome service! Very honest and reasonable. Cyrus is a great guy
"I had a great experience with Blast Auto, I worked with Cyrus and he made me feel comfortable with a reasonable quote. He completed the job and got me back on the road asap. Here is a trusted shop. Will use them again!"
"Very professional and friendly staff at a great price. Highly recommended, very honest work and no surprise fixes. Happy to have found a ""keeper""for all our vehicle needs!"
Did a good job of checking out my car and repairing it.  Highly recommend
The owners are both there every day. They save   me money. I flip cars as a  hobby and the first thing I do every time I get a mystery car problem is take it there. He's a mechanics mechanic.  Honest people
"""Both times went very well, reasonably priced, and I will be back in the future."""

We have all had horror stories about repair shops in the past but I would recommend Master's Auto Service in Cape Coral for anyone needing repairs!  Thanks again Rudy.

"I took my notoriously difficult Volvo s60 2.4 turbo to fix several issues, including a throttle position sensor problem. They informed me of a fair price BEFORE they did any work. They continued to keep me informed through out the repair process. My Volvo rides completely neutral  and throttle response is smooth, and powerful. These guys do great work, at a great value."
They stopped doing what they were doing and took care of me quickly. I had a quick problem to fix and they handle it.
"Brought my car in as it started overheating suddenly. They diagnosed the problem for free and explained the issue before doing any work. After finding out it was a broken water pump that needed to be replaced, I Googled the average cost to repair that issue and their quote was on the low end of that spectrum. The guys were polite and honest. Definitely recommend!"

"Fravel Brewer Orthodontics is the best! They are always so cheerful, kind, and make us feel so welcome every time we come. My son had his braces done here, my second child has them now, and my youngest will have hers next. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!!"
"During this time, when doctors‚Äô offices have nearly closed, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I called the office with a minor emergency since I wasn‚Äôt a patient. Instead, I was given an appointment the same day, and my issue was fixed quickly! Everyone is very friendly, and the tech did an amazing job! I know, because I have had quite a bit of work done in my mouth due to a car accident. I would definitely recommend Fravel Brewer Orthodontics!
I should also say that my daughter recommended the office to me since both of my grandsons have been receiving such excellent treatment!"
"The staff is amazing including the doctors! They are efficient, fast, fun, and very helpful and flexible. Thank you!"
"Great patient care and service. Office staff is very pleasant.  Office is clean, and a fun place to be. My daughter feels special when she goes there and loves the incentives they have. She looks forward to her visits."
Their environment is very welcoming and positive for children. They make the visit a fun one which helps for kids that may be nervous!
Always on-time and high quality. Everyone is empathetic and kind.
"By far and bar none the best orthodontic practice. We drive from Osceola County just to come to them. Extremely friendly and helpful, always available and put the patient first in every way. We will be life long patients without a doubt"
"I‚Äôve been coming to Dr. Fravel for over 25 years! I can‚Äôt believe it. His staff members are all amazing and very friendly. I‚Äôm so glad to see Dr. Brewer joining the practice, too. He appears to be every bit as friendly and professional as Dr. Fravel. And he is an Army Veteran, which is very cool! I love supporting Veteran-owned businesses. I highly recommend this office for anyone looking for one of the best orthodontic practices in Florida!"
"Wonderful, compassionate orthodontist. As an adult patient, I've been extremely comfortable with the whole process. Office is modern, and staff is friendly & efficient. Though my treatment has been longer than initially anticipated, I am impressed with the results. If I had to nitpick, it would be nice if there were Friday hours.
I interviewed a few other orthodontists in the area and was most impressed by the whole package at this office. There are cheaper orthodontists around, but I'm confident that this is one of those things where you ""get what you pay for"". I would give 10 stars if I could!"
"I couldn't be happier with Fravel Brewer Ortho! My kids love them, they do a great job and have a very tween-teen friendly vibe and really seem to know their patients."
"Superb service! The staff and doctor are excellent!  The office is clean and comfortable. They made my son's teeth look perfect.

I interviewed several orthodontists in the area, and I was the most impressed with Dr. Fravel and his staff. Their appointment times and visits are shorter and less frequent, too."
Dr. Fravel is a nice gentleman and extremely approachable. The staff is exceptional and very welcoming. Great at putting you at ease. Office is beautiful and looks like you are in another dimension. Its a pleasure visiting!!! Thank you.
"If you‚Äôre in the market for braces; look no further. This office, from their front to back staff including the Dr. are awesome. Great communication and care for their patients. Very nice office all around."
"I had orthodontics a few years ago in Nashville. Them after moving here, I needed replacement retainers. Dr Fravel's office did a better job with my replacement retainers than the originals. This office is high tech and amazingly friendly. Terrific office that I trust completely."
"I probably can't say enough about how excellent this Orthodontic office is! I'm 23 and just had my braces Put on. I went to 8 different Orthodontics and yes Dr. Fravel was not the cheapest,  but they make you feel so welcome that you will want to do business with them right away.  The office is very clean and show ready,  wich is great. Would definitely recommend it to everyone I know needs braces!"
Very friendly and helpful staff!!! We left with a smile.

BWMS has great faculty and staff. Mr. Jackson the principle is awesome with all the of the student body. I have witnessed his interaction with students and it really made my outlook on the school different due to the care shown. I have been a BWMS parent for about 3 years. I can recall all good experiences with staff. They really try to keep the kids involved and interested. Mrs. Ragussa is AMAZING!!!! She is an English teacher and also the YMCA/after school and summer activities leader. Words really can't explain how awesome this woman is. She is a blessing to all. All in all I love this school and am a proud parent of a student that attends this school. There is always something going on and plenty volunteer opportunities for students.
"I attended BWMS around 2008 or 2009 when the school was brand new to the area.  I absolutely loved this school, I am 20 years old now and still reminisce about my favorite teacher, Mrs. Myers. She was absolutely amazing! She, unlike many teachers today, genuinely cared about her students. She loved us as if we were her own children. She, along with my friends, are what made BWMS a great school for me. I, also, met my bestfriend then and now at BWMS. This school holds a significant amount of great memories of mine. Thank you BWMS!"
Beautiful School.

Have been using this cleaner for nearly 20 years after previous few cleaners did a poor job. This family run business is attentive to their customers needs and clothes are cleaned on site so no shipping to some central warehouse for cleaning.
GREAT cleaners! High recommend for your cleaning needs. They took care of me for 15 years with no issues.
Best cleaners ever! I'm very satisfied with how quick the service was and how clean the clothes were! I definitely recommend.
"Small, yet the best cleaners I've found in S. Tampa in 20 years. Quality is much better than McNatt's at half the price ."

"Mr. Greg Yordon and his staff at the Panama City office are great! They are friendly, courteous, professional and make every effort to meet the needs of their clients. All questions are answered and explained in a way that is easy to understand. The hearing test is explained and any questions I had were answered completely. Mr. Yordon personally made sure I was able to get the hearing aids I needed but still be affordable. He explained the difference in costs between what I ""wanted"" versus what I ""needed"" and all the options in between. Ultimately, his #1 priority is my hearing health needs! To me that makes all the difference in the world. I would recommend Beltone Hearing Care in Panama City to anyone who asks."

Excellent service and professional care. This place are the best.
"Let me tell you something. After finding this AWSOME shop I have no idea what this James Goodwin is talking about. The shop is super clean and organized, the wounderful lady that greets you is very very profesonial and when your machine is done they call you right away to pick it up.  I messed up and put some old gas that I forgot to throw out like they told me to do in my mower that was just fixed. I returned to the shop on a Saturday and Scott fixed my mower right then, now how is that for service when it was MY FAULT. Maybe that was a post for somebody else but that is not the way I was treated and I WILL GO BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN for service like that cause it is VERY HARD to find GOOD service in Miami now a days. AAA keep up the good work. God Bless Your Bussiness"

"Wow!   I called Rat Experts and Edgar came out to my house to check out my rat problem within a very short time.   Edgar was thorough, knowledgeable, and extremely courteous.   My problem was basically structural issues with the house and surrounding foliage that needed maintenance.   Edgar spent time with me to explain how to fix my problem and did not even charge for the service call.   Next time I have a rat issue, I'm calling Edgar, and I highly recommend friends and others should too!   Thank you Edgar for your expert advice and courteous service call and inspection!"
"These guys are great! I really cannot recommend them enough.

I recently purchased a house and have spent the last few months fixing up all the things the previous owners let fall by the wayside. I had signs of a rat in my house and after trapping him and hoping it was over, I was disappointed to hear what sounded like a huge creature in my cupboards. That's when I decided enough was enough and I called Rat Experts. They came out the same day, did a thorough review/walkthrough of my home, and didn't try to oversell me.

They showed me evidence that what I had heard was a raccoon in my crawl space. They told me all the areas I needed to seal up (essentially gaps in the crawl space where creatures were getting through). And set traps for the raccoons.

They also found and patched up a small hole in my kitchen that appeared the be the rodent entrance.

Luckily, my handyman was able to come out and seal up my crawl space two days later.

We never caught the raccoon but that's fine by me. I don't mind creatures out in my yard-- I mind them in my home!"
"I found Edgar online and called him because one of the tenants in a rental property that I own called me to complain about noises coming from the attic.  Edgar went out there, gave me a fair estimate to eliminate the rat infestation and went to work.  When he was done, he explained the remaining treatment process, the neighborhood infestation that surrounded my property and communicated his one year guarantee.  A few weeks after Edgar had completed his job, the rats unfortunately returned.  Living in Miami my entire life, you sometimes cringe when you have to reach out to someone who's already been paid for work they've done.  But I called Edgar and guess what?  He didn't hesitate to return to the property to retreat the infestation.  He went on to explain after he left the property that he's never seen an infestation like this one before.  The rats had devoured all of the poison in the traps he set on the perimeter of the property and had reopened some of the entry points he had previously sealed.  I am very appreciative that Edgar stood behind his guarantee and would recommend him to anyone in a similar situation.  Edgar is the real deal and follows through on his commitments."
"After years if DIY rat trapping proved useless we decided to give rat experts a call and we are so happy we decided to go with them! Edgar is the most professional, friendly, thorough and competent guy we could have asked for! Super reasonable, very quick results for us. What was once a major headache is now problem solved. Zero hassle. Would highly recommend!"
"Excellent service, i definitely recommend ratexperts team. Edgar took care of my rats problem."

"I had a roof leak about two months ago, and after trying to get a hold of Next Gen through their online system and over the the phone, I left the following review:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horrible people, they Never call you back. Ended up driving over to the office and when I get there they say well you could have called or sent an email. They got upset when I say that I  did 10 times already and no one called me back. I had threaten not to leave until someone spoke to me about my unit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After arriving and dealing with a rude receptionist, I spoke to Catherine, the newly hired property manager for our community. She took her time to discuss my concerns, apologized about not receiving my previous correspondence, shared the vision she had for our community and had a roofer out to my unit the next day. I really did appreciate her time, and follow up. I truly believe she is doing her best to improve the reputation and customer service of Next Gen Management and felt the need to update my original review."
Good service.  A little delay in call backs.
I have got to say that this place is awesome! Yuri was the person that attended me through out the entire process and she could not have been more polite and helpful. She filled me in from A to Z as to what was going to happen from initial session to possible sided affects and results. She left nothing to wonder. I went in for laser hair removal. I was a bit shy at first but she made it fell as if I went there over 100 times. And I must  mention how beautiful and modern the place is!! Can't wait till my sessions are over to see my end results. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.
"Friendly and professional staff.  I worked mostly with Amanda, who was excellent.  The spa looks beautiful and relaxing.  Highly recommended."
My favorite med spa in Miami!  The only place I trust.  I highly recommend Yury.  Very professional.  They truly care and always give great advice.  Amanda at the reception is also very helpful and friendly.  I keep recommending the spa to my friends
"I have been going to Prestige for years. I first ran across it when a bought a Groupon. Since then I have developed a great relationship with the owners and staff.  They are professional, clean and honest.  And the services are top notch."
Great staff. Always willing to help you. Bilingual. I have not finish my laser treatment but It looks is going to be great. To treat handicaps person is not recommended because their spa bed is high
Great service and knowledgeable staff!
"(Translated by Google) Excellent place, affordable prices, and all the work team are very professional people in each of their performances, super nice and respectful. I have done several treatments between one of them Laser and the PRP and I feel happy and satisfied with the results, that's why I recommend them 100%.

"I was referred to this company by one of their competitors given that I have a metal roof and not all companies do the tent on metal roofs

They took very good care with the roof, no dents,no scratches, no bends, the boys on the roof were all very slim (definitely a plus in this case)

Very professional services, on time, with warranty, i definitely recommend this company.

We got sms updates on every step with time frames

Before we got the keys back, the inspected the house with a device making sure no gas remain inside the house."
"SPC Services came highly recommended by a family friend. I‚Äôm glad we listened. My husband was sold after the first consultation! SPC Services exceeded our expectations. They provided a level of security that eased our concerns concerning the entire fumigation process and security of our home. They explained the entire process in detail and carried it out exactly! Their  professionalism and competitive prices are beyond impressive!!! The quality of their work exceeded excellence. They scheduled three visits to our home and they were not just punctual, they were on time, every time!!!!!

We give SPC Services a 5 star rating. We highly  recommend this company. You will not be disappointed!!! Thank you for excellence beyond our expectations!!!"
"SPC showed me that quality service and fair pricing is not dead in South Florida. They were very professional, showed up on time, did exactly what they said they would, and most importantly, we didn‚Äôt lose any plants that were very very close to the house. I would recommend them to friends and family. Top notch service and professionalism! Great job guys!!!"

Good treatment and attention from the stylist Odalys, although unfortunately we lost Natalia, but she will always be in the hearts of those who knew her and we come to want as if she were a relative, that God has her in his Glory.
And for Odalys to continue to succeed in his business, with his good care and love for his work.

"It's not easy to find a groomer that you are happy with.  It's even harder with a mobile groomer.

Julee did a great job on our dog.  I explained what we were looking for (I could have been better at that) and Luna came out exactly like what I was trying to say we wanted.

What's more, our dog was very happy afterward.  That is not always the case.  Julee seems to genuinely care about the animals.  The pets know it, and we can tell also.

I highly recommend Julee Mobile Pet Spa.  Trey her, you won't be sorry."
"Ju Lee is awesome! She truly loves animals, and we can tell. I'm sure my pug does tooüòÑ. She believes in keeping her supplies chemical free, so all-natural ingredients as much as possible. I'd highly recommend her to anyone who wants their dog well-taken cared of."
Great communication before hand. On time. And great work!
Julee was so patient and kind to our 16+ year old Shih Tzu.  Highly recommend her.
Julee is awesome.  Call her now.

Buddy suffers from separation anxiety.  Miss Debbie's process of setting the dogs free on the ground when done sure helps him relax.  They do an amazing puppy cut on our Maltese.  He does look more like a puppy after being groomed rather than then his actual nine years.  Wish a hair cut would do the same for me.  Hmmm...I wonder?  Nah.üòÇ‚ù§ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Miss Debi is great! I take all 5 of my dogs to her. She is wonderful with my dogs. Highly recommend her and hubby.
"My dogs quiver with excitement when they get to see Miss Debi! They love it. They look great, smell great, and act as though they feel fantastic. Her workspace is animal oriented. I love her."
"Loves animals, always smiling,
and does a great job grooming my Boykin Spaniel."
Our Charlie goes here as Miss Deb is excellent and cares about her fur babes
Great doggie do's...friendly place
Awesome groomer and service.
Caring and professional dog groomers!

"Nice morning hike, feels like Africa and any moment giraffe or zebra may come out... but only alligators üòÅ

Be prepared and get your hiking permit. Limited availability, so come early morning. Most of the trail is on the sun, don‚Äôt forget your sunscreen and water"
You need to be one of the first people here to get one of the few permits given out each day. There are hundreds and hundreds of gators and it's awesome!

Contracted with Priority to clean & seal my pavers. I am totally satisfied with the results. Alex was very professional and thorough. He took the time to explain to me the entire process and did an excellent job. I would highly recommend the company.
"Amazingly beautiful low pressure job on my balcony!  Prompt, courteous service at a reasonable price.  Highly recommend this team."
"Priority Property Solutions just finished two full days of power washing our condo complex.  They cleaned all exterior surfaces on our buildings and fences.  They did an outstanding job. They got all the rust stains off.  Our homes look new again.  The crew was excellent - personable, professional, conscientious.  I guarantee you will be happy with their work.

"Margie Leturno,APRN, is the epitome of a great provider. Bayfront is lucky to have her as are her patients. The world needs more providers like her. She is very thorough. She does not rush through your appointment to get you out the door. She makes sure you understand lab or diagnostic results and will spend time explaining things to you until you get it. She truely cares about her patients and always goes above and beyond.  I don't think there are enough words in the dictionary to describe her. I have referred quite a few people to her and ALL of them rave about awesome she is. I promise, if you were to make an appointment with her you would not be disappointed."
Miss Margie is a fantastic APRN. She makes you feel comfortable and that all your questions are answered.  Very thorough and knowledgeable.
When I came in the office all the lady's were nice and the nurses very nice and talked to me about the paperwork I had with me and my medical records and Margie talk about medicine where was at and I came over to her she reminds me of my old Dr she was very nice to she took the time to get to know me and my background of medical history
"Margie Leturno APRN is very knowledgeable, informative and very personable.  She answered all my questions and addressed all issues."
Very pleasant Very professional Very happy to have met her!
She‚Äôs a great doctor! Very sweet and really cares!
I had worked with Margie in the past and am so happy to work with her again.  She gave me her undivided attention and I did not feel rushed.
Very nice Dr that took the time to hear the needs I am looking for
