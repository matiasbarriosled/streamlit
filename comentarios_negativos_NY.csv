They got my order wrong  food wasn't done uncooked bacon had too take that out of my sandwich and I ask for egg white they gave me yellow egg
Staff needs to pay attention to what costumers order. They get orders wrong too often. Will avoid in the future.
"Food was burnt and not good. You would think since they are a New York style pizzeria they would have a regular slice of pizza. But when I went they had no regular pizza just random other slices (which were later burnt and didn't taste good) . Anyway there are many other places to go to eat, I don't recommend it."
"This place is horrible. I ordered two ziti pizza's and my friend ordered regular. It tasted like complete garbage. It was 11 dollars for two ziti square pizza's and a can! The guy behind the counter was nice, though. The place looks bigger in these photos but it is not so big. There were no tables open so we and a lot of people were waiting a couple minutes to sit down. PLEASE SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE! THERE ARE BETTER RESTAURANTS!"

Horrible experience due to unprofessional environment especially of micheal.

"Criminally overpriced, but I can let it pass in NYC.  What is unacceptable is the mediocre gelato, and the cardboard - flavored cones.  Avoid it."
I called the town truck on a Saturday night bc a car was Inside my driveway and the lady told me they'll be there in 45 min but never showed up

"I was meeting some friends for lunch nearby and found what looked like a charming little shop. I walked in to find three barbers sitting in their chairs (that should have been my first clue). I sit down, specifically ask if the barber who took me could do a flat top (not to mention they have a specific listing for a flat top on their price list--it's $3 more than the standard $10 haircut). Well, to make a long story short, I could have gotten a better haircut at the local butcher shop. My only consolation is that hair grows. Avoid at all costs."
Want to ruin your hair? This is the perfect spot. RIP my hairline
Poor service

"The food is dried out, tastes of nothing, and is way overpriced. I wouldn't eat here if they were giving the food away!"

"What a terrible experience... The staff at the front desk and the manager are rude, incompetent and they simply don’t belong anywhere near customer service. They’re not there to help. I wonder why the place is always empty... If you’re going to gym to get rid of some stress, this is not the place. They’ll gladly add more of that stress and negativity to your day..."
"Do not, I repeat DO NOT join this gym. All you need to do is google the name Mike at Tribeca Gym then read all the negative reviews before agreeing to join. I joined Tribeca on 4/29 and was charged $53 bucks.  ($3 prorated for April and $50 for May).  On May 5th, I was charged an additional $50 for May. I spoke with Lauren and informed her I was charged twice for May.  She said oh, if you decide to leave the gym that will be your last payment. Well two weeks later I decided to leave Tribeca Gym and join NYSC.   On June 1, I was charged an additional $50 bucks.  I emailed Mike the owner and informed him I was charged twice in May so I should not have to pay for June.  I even emailed him my bank statement and he had the nerve to tell me it was shell gas station that charged me twice. I mean come on really, like I don’t know how to read my bank statement. After going back and forth I told him to keep the $50 however I plan on making a complaint with the BBB.  My advice is to stay clear away from this gym.  Do your research about Mike and join a real gym like NYSC.  THANK GOODNESS I cancelled my membership.  His customer service skills SUCK!!!!!"
There's a small 5ft3 manager there who's ppl skills are horrendous. He's always mad

The food is below average and the price is exorbitant. There are a lot more good restaurants in the area that offer better food for a lot cheaper.

NEVER HEARD OF THEM
"(Translated by Google) They were hindering me with paying and for 3 months they did nothing for my house, they only called collect and when I called to find out about my marriage nobody knew anything, to the point that I had to record each call. They are disgusting people. Pay more than 3,000 for nothing. The worst thing is that they are Latin @ s our people who disgust

Me estaban estorcionando con pagar y por 3 meses no hicieron nada por mi casó, solo llamaban por cobrar y cuando llamaba para saber de mi casó nadie sabía nada,asta al punto que tuve que grabar cada llamada.

"Did not remove all of acrylic that was on my nails previously. Then lied and said when done, the huge waves & bumps in my nails were my own damaged nail beds. All because he wanted to save time in a place that wasn't even busy. What he didn't know, was I had been a nail tech many years ago and know better. Not the most professional. His kids were running/yelling around salon. Will not return."

"Mike, one of the reps, had no problem telling me gay folks are ruining society. He waited until the transaction was complete. Yes, I was wearing a pride shirt.

I was just looking for beer and hamburger buns. Not sure I'm bringing my gay dollars back here."

I waited 20 mins for service and never received any help . After speaking to the manager of the store he did nothing to help . And all i was doing was dropping off a package.
Haven't been here
"(Translated by Google) The package arrived three days late! And no representative even tried to help! The worst service there is in deliveries from personal experience is better ups.

"Horrible bank with even worse customer service. Heidy the branch “manager” is not only condescending and rude but she is also bad at her job. Sterling bank is useless from top to bottom, outdated app and employees that just dont care. Theyll be closed soon because of incompetence, especially from people that don’t deserve to be in a supervisory position."
The worst of the worst.  Why anybody would use this bank when there are so many better choices is beyond my comprehension
Bank is closed.
They charged me $400 to paint half of my bumper and the paint pealed off. Shotty work.
I called to ask a question about my car the representative was very nice and kool on the phone I ask her can I talk on of the mechanics he came on phone very nasty and rude his name is  Moses very unpleasant with how he came to me
"Piffle!!  Wasted my time due to ineptitude.

I live near here so I go every so often. Yogurt is only average. Couple of things I noticed: the help almost NEVER thank you for a tip.  A few times I visited they were blasting some horrid Top 40 station, I was sure I was going tio hurl. We begged for them to turn it down.

More importantly, I found out tonight that their Google page says they are open until 9:00 on weeknights, which is in fact incorrect. They close at 8:00. If this is only review #3, than I am a little surprised. Clearly, someone is clueless as to their Internet trail, which is stinking.   -just lost another customer. Sorry, I'm old school and I don't patronize cavalier establishments that pay no attention to their advertised times of conducting businerss."

Please stop running so many left-wing outrage pieces.  Some of us don't want to be reminded of losses like 2000 and 2016.
"Great prices, great staff overall great place to shop."

"The food was OK, the service was prejudice, they want to see foreigners, their own people. I had to get my own menu, my own check brought an appetizer without sauce, totally ignored us.  I normally give 30% tip but this time, just 15% mark"
Rude rude rude ... this doctors office is highly unprofessional... wouldn’t recommend this place to no one will be taking my children out of this office immediately

"Have tried 3 times this week to have my mother's oxygen delivered and now have sat home all day, AGAIN, waiting. You know... OXYGEN, that people NEED to breathe! Had one of the customer service reps get loud and try to talk over me.
I can't wait to get away from this company."
"They really are the worst. I ordered CPAP supplies three times and still have not received anything. You guys are messing with people's health and lives. It seems like they don't want to be in business. I wish I could give them zero stars.

Update: Finally got my order and surprise, it was a complete cluster and incorrect. Avoid at all cost."
"I'm not sure how this place is around. They recently bought out continued care and it has been a huge step down in all respects. Supply order came incorrect and after 7-8 days, whereas continued care would always fullfil orders correctly and within 1-2 days max. In addition, getting a hold of someone on the phone is like winning the lotto. Today alone I wasted my poor cell phone's battery cells to deal with 60 minute hold times, followed by a hang up, then a 90 minute hold time, followed but me giving up. I'm going to research my options for finding a different supplier."
Good luck. Getting someone on the phone and if you do they will transfer you to someone else.
This place shouldn't be in existence. Abosolute worst medical company. They should be embarrassed to be in business.
Zero stars

"125 Street /Park Ave is the Metro -North's Harlem line stop. It's the corridor  to the NYC subway system which is a block's walk to the east . Unlike the mid-town Grand Central it's not a physical structure, it's mainly a transit hub. Like any hub in NYC its a magnet for homelessness and hustlers and panhandlers. In addition their is a lot of Opioid treatment centers nearby so be on point always. Like in the movies the police are never around until after something happens.  As the area becomes gentrified hopefully things will get better."
Well made deli sandwiches
"They are not as advertised, I didn't feel comfortable or cared for, I Left and won't be going back there or too any other place that's Like it.

"Nothing like watching a driver blow through a red light! Thankful I do not have kids nor know anyone who uses this bus. I’ve tried calling to report this female driver who is driving extremely reckless but no one answers the phone. She’s really I wasn’t going 4 mph faster or I would of T boned her. Bus number 2415 female Mexican driver driving in Sunnyside queens 1250pm 12-11-2020

Since no one will answer the phone and after reading all the terrible reviews I will be reaching out to nyc and file a complaint against your company."
They never pick up their phone
Crappy company they only hire spanish people the matrons are stupid they have no idea what’s going on not trained calling customer service is a waste. Children are not safe this company sucks. People who work for the company will say anything who care about your thoughts your working for a crappy company I’m sure you know what’s going on you sound and look stupid happy to work for this company what a complete dummy
Horrible office workers bad attitudes
"The driver had her headphone on while driving in Manhattan, she obvious, didn't want to hear the kids and /or streets, I have pictures that I can send to prove that. I saw that on Friday, 03/03/16. as she drove by me at 224 W 18th St."

It started out Great. So I was reserving my opinion. But my next visit he wasn't interested in my condition.  An asked what I was their for today ??? I had gone in with my a foot numb my knee in pain I had been diagnosed with bicep tendonitis and obviously my neck was bulging on one side. The first time he treated all of my injuries the second time just my neck.
"Very poor service, very hot & poorly set up for a summer wedding."
"Had a simple dinner, just wanted to eat a little for the family, but it cost me over $180 for 10 small dishes. All dishes were so small that I thought there was small to large in size when order. Food is acceptable but not great. I'm sure I'll not go back and recommend to anyone."
If you can't get anywhere else to go it's a good place to go
Just nasty
