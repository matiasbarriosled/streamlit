"The chicken sandwich was delicious! There's definitely a twist on the flavor maybe even a little bit fishy, this is not your average chicken sandwich but it's so good. I also got spicy instead of mild and it's kinda spicy, it left my lips burning.
The staff was nice and it looks like they've added outdoor seating.
I can't wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu."
Love this place  fried garlic chicken was very crispy and savory. Also like that they give you a side or Korean coleslaw calm the heat while adding another element.
"엘에이에 살때 자주 먹었는데 당근 소스가 정말 맛있습니다. 근데 아쉽게도 라미라다점에는 당근소스가 없네요.

다만 쌈 메뉴를 처음 먹어봤는데 정말 맛있습니다. 튀긴 치킨은 먹을땐 맛있어도 먹고나면 속이 다소 불편한 경우가 있는데 구운 치킨이라 속도 편하고 맛있어요. 남으면 에어프라이기에 살짝 돌려도 퍽퍽해지지 않아 좋아요 적극 추천 합니다"

"Easy process, extremely friendly, helpful staff. In and out with three kids in 20mins."
My girlfriends and I took a weekend ski trip to Mammoth and rented from Black Tie. The service and prices were amazing! They even came to our house to change out skies and pick them up before we left. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely rent from here next time! 🎿
"The team at Black Tie never disappoints our service expectations. It’s clear that the service integrity is spot-on every time we walk in the door. We always use the service located at Sierra Nevada Resort. Again, with our trip this crazy New Years weekend, Jason was on point with fitting your kids with the gear that will deliver the highest safety and most definitely memeroies that will last a life time... Thanks Black Tie (Jason) for always taking excellent care of our needs."
"Great service, fast, responsive, they came and picked up our rentals from our condo when we were done"
Awesome!  Incredible customer service. Professional staff. Great quality gear. Incredibly easy experience from the first phone call to the personalized fitting in the comfort of our own accommodations. You guys rock!
They make the burden of getting and renting skis tolerable and with great service
"Unforgettable, remarkable, customer for life. I just got back with a family of five from 4 days of skiing in mammoth mountain. Being the sole person that had to arrange everything using BTS made the process smooth, easy, accommodating and fantastic. I haven't been skiing in 20 years and this was my first time back with small kids and seniors some who have never skied before. The whole staff was incredible and unbelievably over the top, friendly, helpful and nice. It's rare to find service like this these days. I am a VERY hard customer to please. Nothing EVER goes right for me and being in business for my self I am extremely critical of any little thing that goes wrong, from a crooked uniform, personal appearance, a slip of the tongue, a roll of the eyes, or a hint of a bad attitude none of that was present when dealing with this organization. They bent over backwards in being available, handling special requests, dealing with my problems, last minute changes and making me feel like I was their best and only customer on the entire mountain. Like a few of the others I rarely write reviews, however these people more than exceeded expectations and totally blew me away. I want to go out of my way to tell you this place is - PHE-NOM-A-NAL!!!"

"Nice people, good service."

I like this paint store they always have the stuff i need good service
Very helpful staff! I have not used their paint but this was in our neighborhood and accepts old paint for recycling. Hassle free!
"Amazing paint!  We had never used Dunn-Edwards paint and we are absolutely impressed with the results!  Single coat, no need to touch up!  We are thrilled with the results!

The staff at Rancho Cordova were very helpful!  Thanks!

Was this review …?"
"If your looking to get a exact color match, this is the place to go. Friendly knowledgeable staff will get you the product you need in a timely manner.  Highly recommended"
"Excellent service,  everything I needed. And a promo shirt thanks. I'll be back."
The pros here go above and beyond to accommodate.  Thanks Kurt and Brittany - helpful people like you keep me coming back : )
Great customer service.
Counter ladies were a great help!

"Haven't been here yet i just wanted to comment on the owner's response to jr sass's review.... ""That was awesome! LMAO! If there was a ""Best owner's resonse to customer reviews"" competition, yours would surely win Top position!"
Got me in quick. The massage therapist was really strong but the massage wasn't really relaxing. I felt more beat up. Still the prices are good n The hot towels felt good.
I have had two really great massages at this place from Cici. She does really good deep tissue massage. And it has helped me greatly. Very clean place. Very professional.
"Wow! Yummy! One of the best massages ever. Authentic, professional honest yet sensual and exciting. Ill be back!
*
Ok so 3rd time here.. Different girl each time and all were truely exceptional massages. If you like a slow sensuous massage ask for Linda! Tell her J sent ya."
Great one hour massage. Massage therapist had more experience than I would have every imagined with finding my problem areas and tasting them with the attention needed.
Good massage  for back pain
Great massage from Katie.

Outstanding service. Received Full 1 hour

"Just alright. Paid 35 dollars for 30 mins, which is quite a bit more than I would usually pay (but I REALLY needed a massage). The masseuse had me enter a completely private room dimly lit with ambient music playing (very relaxing) The massage was done without clothes (also something I’m not used to)

In the end, I’m giving it a 4 star because it was a little more expensive for the quality of massage."
Doesn't have happy endings :(
Totally awesome experience

Lisa the owner is a great person and gives one of the best massages I have ever had and have been back several times and every visit was great. She takes the time to work on what spot needs it most. She is the new owner and worth a visit. Great rates too.
"I was a little skeptical at first but the massage was awesome.  A little painful but the next day I felt amazing and to my surprise, the pain I had been experiencing was gone.  Definitely recommend."
Always a great message at Good Massage

This beauty bar is amazing. The employees are so respectful and are very concerned with their work and their clients feelings regarding their work. Also the prices for things are not bad at all. I totally recommend this place if you are looking for a new beautician.
Sherri is fantastic with curly hair. She has a wealth of information and is happy to share. Thank you are an awesome experience my daughter and I loved it!
"I stopped in to purchase some products, as my hair dresser does not carry Kevin Murphy.  Everyone was very helpful and professional.  The lady who helped me took her time to explain and help recommend the right products for my hair."
Go see Sherri! She is amazing! Super cute shop. All the girls are great & friendly!
"The place is really great! Steffany is amazing, she is like a wizard who from my ""haystack""  :) created something beautiful. I like my new hair color. Looks so natural and healthy!"
One of the best Salons in the greater Sacramento area. Seriously all the ladies here are so educated they can do wonders with you hair.
Leah is amazing.   Love this place
Destiny it's the best at figuring out what you want.
Its a Fabulous place I love it!
"Best salon ever,Leah Totten is the very best,must visit this salon!"
Great environment to get your hair done by an amazing group of ladies.
Definitely something worth trying. If you’ve never had Hard Kombucha you need to come here. It’s very different and the inside is beautiful. They have a variety of games and there is plenty of seating.
Best Kambucha in the world ! 👌 family friendly too.
"My first experience with hard Kombucha, from this awesome experience it will certainly not be my last. Loved the atmosphere of Local Roots. It's a casual lounge with giant jenga, connect four, and other yard games. I appreciate the volume of music was low enough to comfortably have a conversation/play games with friends. The hand made wood plank tables add loads of positive astatic to the space. I see myself turning this place into a regular hangout."
"I love kombucha and been waiting for a kombucha brewery to open up. I normally love boochcraft but they were taking to long. Didn’t even know local roots existed until I came for a private event. Thank goodness! The kombucha is good and the best thing it’s alcoholic and still has that good effect of kombucha! The place is big and cool. Pet friendly. Live band. Only thing I didn’t really like is too many kids running around crazy. It’s like they are drunk of the non alcoholic one! This is where all the mommies go and let their kids run wild! I don’t blame them, it’s because it’s delicious and can’t let the kid hold you back from getting your kombucha fix."
"Beautiful place to come relax and have a drink. They don't have food so don't come hungry, but instead come ready to have great drinks and enjoy some games"
"Where to start? Such a great spot to have drink. The kombucha is not very acidic or super sweet like I was expecting from experiences at other places. They have a menu with a good amount of tasting options and believe me when I say they all taste REALLY good. The Strawberry Mojito was excellent, I definitely recommend starting there if its your first time with kombucha.
Local Roots looks and smells like its brand new, and from my opinion they have made the space into a very nice place to come after work and enjoy some downtime. They have Jenga and Cornhole for entertainment as well as a couple TVs and plenty of seating space.
Definitely a spot I will be visiting again soon and I would recommend this place as a must visit spot."
Love this place. Amazingly fresh kombucha every time I go. I've had other booch and doesn't compare to what I drink here. 10/5 stars if I could.
Great first experience with hard kombucha. Staff was very helpful and informative which made the biggest difference. I will definitely be back again.
Very easy to get to and very easy to deal with. We will be back!
"Super chill space with yummy kombucha (lots in the 5% to 7% alcohol range.) Bar tenders are friendly and knowledgeable. If only it was closer to the beach... I like that the Kombucha is full bodied and well flavored. I like the Cali Mule, but the hoppy habanero is nice mixed with the watermelon basil. Tables with games are available."
Good stuff
Excellent location that sells alcoholic kombucha and a number of non-alcoholic kombucha.
Best Hard Kombucha around!
Not bad for a sweet beer.

Great place to take your car for all your car needs. It's a busy shop which says alot about the company.
Amazing customer service. Harry was the best. He just secured a loyal customer. Will be returning. 5 Stars Harry!!!
"The owner is great, he hires a great staff.i spend a little of money here, i would not take my cars anywhere else."
"VERY HONEST shop, great service and very reasonable prices. My mother-in-law comes here all the time and had mentioned it a few times. Will definitely be coming back moving forward.

Huge Thank You for the great work!"
"great service, great prices, extremely high integrity.

I went in to get a tire puncture repaired, fearing i had waited too late in the day and they would be busy.

Very pleasantly surprised, 20 minutes and $25 dollars later i asked for a recommendation on new tires because i am unhappy with the traction on the ones i have.

Pete told me to come back next year - he would feel bad taking my money because i do not need new tires now.

That was the start of a longer conversation, but you get the idea."
Man they hooked my car up with a four wheel  Alignment great work and Pete was great. Going to take my other car there.
"Best customer service and fast,quality workmanship...If I could give 10 stars,I would..👍"
"Great place

"I always feel welcome here, and happy when I leave.

Joni does a great job with my hair, and everyone does great on my nails"
Love Kim and Danny! They are like a member of our family. I have been going to them for years! Fabulous nails!
"I am extremely glad that I came to Excel for my Japanese straightening after much research on the products. Jeremy did an excellent job and I am very happy with my results and the cost! I will be returning for regular touch ups, and manicures!"
Polite as soon as I walked in.  Very clean and organized.  I will definitely go back to Excel Hair and Nails.  They offer a wide range of services (males and female).  :)
They do a good job and the salon is very nice and clean.
"Open inside for haircut.  Good job, good value.  Open outside for nails."
"Great nails. Attention to detail is a plus for me. Thank you. Hair color....time will tell. Going a bit darker, chestnut with a few lowlights."
"Mai does a great job. She is expert at hair coloring and I receive compliments on the vibrancy yet naturalness of the color.  She is sweet and always listens to my requests, which is often not the case with stylists.

On another note, this salon had a change of ownership in this past year and I see that the negative reviews are from before that change occurred. My family enjoys our experiences at Excel."
Great place for haircut
Tammy is the best!

"Excellent service, very attentive employees, excellent service. I enjoy buying from them plus all of the variety of nice things."
Lots of beads lot of little things you can actually purchase to make bracelets necklaces and the lady at the front she was really nice but besides that you're going to have to find the things on your own the prices are adequately affordable what overall is just a little bit above average service I would probably give it three and a half stars but the lady at the front was really nice so decided to give her four.
"I was here in 2015, I spent $50.00 & came back with quite a few crystals, by the strand...so happy...the other time was in 1988...."
I popped in to pick up a 441 Hoodie and then fell in love with the receptionist! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I said it before my local 441 to bad Mr. Richard samaniego is  retired such a great person very nice he would greet you with a smile Al the time.
Mitch was very helpful and knowledgeable. Would recommend to family and friends.

The only shop that I bring my 2006 sprinter. They are incredibly honest and helpful.

Just got a tattoo and I'm really greatful they were able to take my friends and me even after hours. The shop has such a chill vibe and everyone seemed really receptive to walk ins and questions. Mars did our tattoos and was really patient and thorough with all of us. Honestly the least painful tattoo I've ever had and it came out better than expected.
"First of all, a BIG SHOUT OUT to Keelie! Keelie is  very professional, talented tattoo artist! This was my first tattoo and he not only made sure he studied my tattoo he made me feel as comfortable as possible!

Great prices, great quality...hard to beat"

At this time of year the spots that we chose were shaded and not a whole lot of bugs. Which was very good for me! All of the other campers around us were courteous, plus it was cold enough that there were enough empty spots in between that we barely noticed other campers lol The off roading was a blast!!!! Really cannot wait to go back!"

"Best nail salon in Orange County and LA - hands down. My nails have never looked better. Amazing service and I love all of the girls that work here. Even when I lived in LA, I drove down here to get my nails done because no one- even the best in LA could make my hands look this good AND the places that do come close are double the price. If you want beautiful nails for a great price- this is your spot.

*They also sell amazing lotions and scrubs that make your skin feel baby soft.*"
I had a great experience there! They have earned themselves another customer.
Fast and good quality.

"Dr. Only has helped me so much! Even when I had an emergency( tooth crumbled), she made arrangements for me to come in right away so she could fix it! It hurt really bad but she kept soothing me  saying that it would be out quite fast!

Even if there was a dentist that said that they are better,I  would never consider going another dentist,she is great! She is the only dentist who has been so kind to me!!!!!
If I was able to star her more I would give her a 10++++++!"
"I haven't been to the dentist in 10 years, can you imagine? Fear and finances kept me from going. I am so so so pleased that my friend referred me to Appealing Dentistry. They are welcoming, friendly, sincere, affordable, and have helped me deal with my dental fears. They have earned my trust, and I will gladly refer my closest friends and family."
I have been a patient at Appealing Dental for many years and I have recommended Dr. Taitz to my coworkers. She is kind and very professional. She is worth the drive!
She and her assistant were wonderful with my sister. I can't thank them enough!
The whole office of staff our very friendly and the dentist alwaz does good work on my teeth . The receptionist is so sweet also very friendly and open on saturdays
Thank you
Great Company!

My hair lady April Ferri is the best hair cutter known to human!
What an awesome place to get yourself a haircut! I needed to fix my shaggy hair before the holidays and April hooked me up. I let her know a few particulars and she worked her magic. The great part is I've already gotten compliments from family members! To make the deal even sweeter this place has convenient street parking and super affordable covered garage parking next to the salon. I'm definitely coming to Windows Peak and April for my next haircut!
"Love this place. It's a little set back from the road, so don't miss it - it's upstairs in the shopping precinct and if you're driving they validate parking in the lot. Bring yourself, ask for Sandra - book ahead since they get busy and walk-ins aren't always guaranteed."

"This shop is owned n run by a group of Asians. Very warm and friendly people. Haircuts were $15 with most customers giving a $5 tip. So a visit could easily set u back $20. There r 6 barber chairs spaced 6 feet a part and the barbers wore masks. After one customer departed, the barber's chair was sprayed down and all used instruments were cleaned.
It appeared all covid protocols were followed.
There was a bathroom on the premises and plenty of parking in front... handicap parking also. Highly recommended."
"Nice Barber. Guy did a really good job, can't complain."
Excellent skills. Jose is one of the greatest barbers there. My Husband use to cut his hair with him now my sons get there hair cut by him. He's the best
This was my first time visiting this shop. I entered and there was like 4 barbers one of the four barbers was busy with client. There was this female barber who was just sitting there said she was waiting for client with appointment. And there was this elderly lady falling asleep on her chair so i was not sure bout her lol. So anyways this barber at the end was not busy so he gave my son a haircut and he did a good job. This place is based more on appointments if they are not busy they will take walk-ins. It was just $18.00 for my sons haircut not bad.
"Jose is a master barber, best shop in town. Very quick, and closely pays attention to detail, leaving you walking out there feeling a new man"
This place is amazing plus you get a fresh cut as you want it... Pass by and get you hair cut...✂💇 To look like fresh.... 🤔😕

"Originally chose this location because they had sedation for procedures and I don't have fond memories of the Dentist.

What keeps me coming back is the fact that the staff remember me, even after 6 months between cleanings. Everyone in the office is nice, polite and kind. It seems like they want to make the Dentist a positive Expierence for everyone!

I highly recommend stopping in if your looking for a dentist. Smile Dental gave me options and weren't pushy when offering recommended treatments, they even worked with me on figuring out payments and insurance coverages to maximize my benefits."
"Dr. Vihn and his staff and very professional and experienced. They listen to client concerns and address each question with precision and solid information. Dr. Vihn has taken care of my husband, my children and myself. So hard to believe my youngest daughter entered the office smiling!"
"I've found my dentistry!  NOT. I've been through the gamut of dentists over the years but this is ""the one"".  After being ripped off with leaking, failing root canals and 1000's of dollars spent at other dentistry's I'm quite sure San Marcos Smile Dentistry is my dentistry.  NOT!!  Since joining, I've had two teeth pulled, bridge work done, a root canal and a teeth cleaning and I am totally pleased with the results...OR SO I THOUGHT.... My, how first impressions change!  I
wiIl l NEVER return to this hack artist dentistry!  After my final visit I noticed two teeth that had holes drilled through the enamel between the teeth.. One of those teeth have now rotted off and the other is decaying.  I lost my dental insurance and don't have the money to get it repaired.  My tongue felt the holes right away although I never got around to going back.  Now my front tooth next to the canine is rotting and 75% gone..... It's almost like they purposely damaged my good teeth to drum up more business.  I will never go back there unless its for a pro bono tooth repair job to fix the damage they caused!"
Everyone is very nice yes I would recommend them to my friends

"Great place for phone repairs and to get phone cases. Their repair prices are reasonable compared to the Apple Store and I recommend getting repairs here if you’re out of warranty. They have a great case selection and can order whatever case you want as well. Their screen protectors are a must-have and their warranty on them is great! If your case or screen protector breaks (not caused by you, meaning a case defect), they replace it free of charge if you have the receipt."
Tim fixed my iPad that was run over by a car. Great guy and great service.

"This Barber Shop is awesome. I like how they keep you entertain while you wait. They put on the NFL games or movies and good music. They also  provide you with free wifi. The price is real good for the professional haircut!And the owner has been around  since 1985. Also on Friday, Saturday, and Sundays are always real busy all the time! So be ready to wait an hour to get seen but the service is great! I'll recommend to make an appointment during the weekdays Mon-Thur for faster service."
"Excellent service. The barbers know how toncut hair. Great classic music for all types of people. Plus my boys loved that they had donuts in the morning to Offer. Friendly, outgoing and professionalism."
Took my sons in to get a haircut 4 and 6 year old even tho i was passed the closing time they got them in and did a great job we will be returning.

"I gifted my mom a massage here.  While I'd never personally visited the salon, the reviews were incredible so I trusted the feedback.  I am SO glad I did.  My mom had a massage from Jessica and said that it is the BEST massage she has ever received.  Additionally, my mom said it is very clean, and the staff is extremely friendly.  I'm so grateful that they took such great care of my mom.  This is now my new go-to spot!!"
Leslie gave me the best massage I've had in a long time I will definitely be back
Becca is awesome. She is such the nicest person. This was my first time coming for a facial and the experience has me reeling. I wouldn't mind coming back again and getting a membership. This is an awesome place to come. Come and try them out you'll love it.
Jessica is a dream. I've tried plenty of massage therapists over the years here in San Diego (for lower back pain) and she is hands down my all time favorite. The new location is super clean with plenty of parking which is always a nice perk. Love the deep tissue.. she also has online booking that actually works. I feel lucky to have found her. Thank you!
Amazing amazing a must

Keep it going."

"I went to Nika Skincare for eyelash lift / perm. It was my first time and i didn't even know the difference at the time. She examined my lashes and told me I probably need both, since my eyelashes are long but basically grow towards the floor lol I had a last lift before at another place, but i saw not much of a result. This time, at Nika Skincare, my lashes were super lifted and i see awesome result. She took the time with me and carefully did the lifting. I felt comfortable the entire time. I highly recommend going to Nika Skincare!!!"
I got facial in Nika Skin Care. Lida did a fantastic job.  It was extremely relaxing.  The entire staff were very professional and kind.  The products they used were extremely effective and soothing.
I received a great facial scrub. My skin felt so much smoother afterwards and Niki is super sweet and skillful. Would highly recommend.
"Just got a microdermabrasion from Nika and I am SO impressed with how my skin looks.

Nika made me feel so comfortable and relaxed that I almost fell asleep. Her hands are gentle but firm. She is super knowledgeable in skincare and a very sweet woman. Wonderful experience!!
