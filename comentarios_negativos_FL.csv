"Update: Their “reply” to my review amounted to nothing. They never followed up with me. This doctor has left me without medication and not enough time to find a new doctor and get my prescriptions refilled because I came down with COVID. I have been abandoned with no recourse. I will be calling the state to file a complaint and will not drop this. Having to reschedule two to three appointments (appointments were not back to back as I was accused) over the course of two years (with more than twenty four hours notice) is NOT grounds to abandon your patients. I’m still fuming over the male at the front desk who laughed like a hyena when I questioned why I was being dropped. Steer clear of this place.

UPDATE: I followed their link and submitted report. I’ll update here if anything comes from it. Forgot to mention, I was told I missed three appointments in a row by the laughing man on staff. It isn’t true. I missed one because I had been sick and needed labs done before my appointment. I had just seen the doctor and was given new meds at my previous appointment.  I had an appointment already scheduled for September and while I’m waiting on refills, they instead cancel me and remove me as a patient.

Love the doctor but was cancelled  as a patient after calling in to reschedule three (only two with this doctor-one was with previous doctor) appointments (they were not consecutive appointments, and I always called in advance so they could fill the spot) so they have now cancelled my next appointment and refuse to fill my meds. No one notified me. So much for all my family going to one doctor. I now get to move myself, my mom, and my husband to another office. Office manager guy repeatedly  laughed at me when I called to question what happened. As a nurse, his behavior was rude and unprofessional. I loved this doctor and his nurse. It’s a shame I’m punished for doing what I thought was right….. one cancelled for being extremely sick, one because my son was in ICU, and a third because my mom had surgery and I couldn’t leave her…. But they were notified well in advance. I’m angry."
"I was told he is a good doctor. I was trying to call to make a appointment this morning.  First call, they told me the girl taking appointment went to the bank. Second call, i was told to hold- 5 minutes,  still not come back, so I hung up. Very disappointed! !!"
"You are better off walking your item to it's destination. I mailed something with this establishment 3 days ago. I have yet to be able to track it with the tracking number they provided me. They gave me no receipt for my purchase and when I inquired they told me ""we don't have to give you a receipt, if you don't ask"". They told me the post office ""should scan it in today or tomorrow, other than that, I can't help you"". They didn't open an investigation to find my item and they could not have displayed less interest. The post office has since stepped in to help me. They basically negated everything this business owner told me about my transaction. They have absolutely zero idea of what they are doing. The post office confirmed that they did not receive my mail from this location on the date I mailed it. DO NOT MAIL FROM HERE. They are AWFUL!!"
"We've sent extremely urgent International package on Friday , just found out on Tuesday (the day it was supposed to be delivered abroad) that it was still sitting in their location and not being carried out to DHL carrier (they're DHL ""Authorized"" Shipping Center)
When asked about the explanation, none was given. No apology, like nothing wrong happened.
I called to DHL on Tuesday and they called me back apologizing, saying the agent (Mail Station) did not handled it right and they are going to ""coach"" them. As I checked the BBB rating of the Mail Station, it's D MINUS - no wonder this is something I've encountered. Mail Station do not care about their customers. I asked Nancy, the employee to ask an owner to contact me to resolve it properly. No one called me. Finally I've confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, that my package was picked ups finally by DHL and it's going to be on it's way.

This is a Mail Station, this is what they should be doing for their as a core business - sending packages on time."

"Had a customer walk-in cooler go down in Cape Coral at 630p Monday, 07/05/21. Checked the online app, showed the compressor needed in stock. Sent a tech to the location to save time. Called the after hours operator to have the on-call rep call and meet us. No call after 1.5hrs. Called again, no return call."
"I called on Monday to schedule an appointment. I was SO excited because I saw amazing reviews and I really needed to fix my hair. We scheduled it for Saturday at 10am. I made sure to have the lady on the phone repeat the date and time to make sure I wrote it down correctly. Sure enough it was correct, Saturday at 10am. So I come in excited on Saturday. You can ask anyone how thrilled I was to try this place... and then disappoint set in.. I was asked what I was there for and I told her I had an appointment at 10am. She asked my name and she told me I missed my appointment on Friday.. Uhm no. I would not have scheduled it on Friday because I had prior plans already made. If I missed it, why didn't I even receive a phone call? And I know for a fact my appointment was on Saturday at 10am. I find out the girl who was supposed to do my hair isn't even there. And I get told that it would have to be rescheduled for next week... so of course I'm bummed, I feel embarrassed because it looked like my fault when it's not and no attempt was made to resolve the issue, no apologies, and absolutely 0 empathy. Not planning to give them my business."

I need my money back I put in wash machine number two it did not rinse my clothes I had to hand rinse every piece  by hand.  What's the number to call? It is not posted at all this robbery and a quick way to take peoples money for free.

"What a colossal disappointment. I placed my order on the recommendation of my neighbor. I saw my credit card account was charged 26.54 for the vegetable box the next day. I received my email confirmation/ receipt one day before delivery. On the delivery date, my neighbor received half his order, sent a timely text and the driver came back to deliver the rest of the order. My order was never delivered. When I realized my order didn’t arrive, I tried to call, straight to voicemail, voicemail is full, can’t even leave a message. I sent a text that day to let them know that I didn’t get my delivery. Two days later they reply that, they could not have made a mistake because the GPS shows they were there at my address. It’s a condominium, of course they were there, I know they were there, because my neighbor got his delivery. They suggested that I should interrogate my neighbor, he probably has my order. My neighbor got what he ordered, nothing more. Then another text says my credit card has been  refunded, but we don’t believe you. As if, SWFL Produce cannot make a mistake. Grow up and stop trying to blame your insufficiencies on others. What legitimate business writes a customer crying that they are going to lose $26. All I wanted was a GD box of vegetables delivered to my door. That never happened and never will."

"3rd and last time. Three times I have been to this place to close it forever. Unprofessional, lack of courtesy, they work like if your head is a coconut, and leave untrimmed spots. On top of that at the end you might get full of most of your cut hair; they don't know how to remove the cover properly.

"(Translated by Google) The person who cut me did not know how to handle my hair. I asked him for a specific cut and he had long enough hair to do it, what happened ... He cut me so short that the cut I asked for was no longer possible, but he left my hair very uneven. Also let him know that I did not like the cut and stared at me as if he wanted to kill me. I am not the barber, he has to know how to handle everyone's hair and also be humble and accept that he did not do well. ""Thank you for damaging my hair that with so much sacrifice I let it grow for months to achieve the cut I wanted""

La persona que me recorto no supo manejar mi cabello. Le pedí un corte especifico y tenía el pelo bastante largo para hacerlo, que pasó... Me corto tan corto que ya no se pudo hacer el corte que le pedí mas me dejo el cabello bien disparejo. Ademas le deje saber que no me gusto el corte y se quedo fijamente mirandome como si me quisiera matar. Yo no soy el barbero, el tiene que saber manejar el cabello de todo el mundo y también ser humilde y aceptar que no lo hizo bien. ""Gracias por dañarme el cabello que con tanto sacrificio me lo deje crecer por meses para lograr el corte que deseaba"""

"Horrible. Ruined my haircut. The owner got irate when I told her I wasnt happy and accused me of wanting a freebie, lol, I could buy her business and do a better job. They advertise as dominican but they are not. Beware. Cuidado con el engaño. No son dominicanas."
Would not recommend terrible job at matching color and worst hair cut I have ever had.
Been with this bank now for several years after relocating back to brevard.  During this Covid they claim to offer help by offering the hero auto loan or refinancing  for first responders.  I currently have an existing loan with them for 2 years now. Never a late payment or issue with my accounts. My credit score met the requirements for the loan but my debt to income ratio was to high. Due to student loans and they actually are counting utilities that have also never been late because I used Experian boost and they said utilities would boost credit score. I do have students loans and all are current.  So I am confused you would rather act as crooks and charge me higher interest rates cause I have proven faithful in paying my bills but consider me a risk for a lower interest rate which would make the payments lower for me so if someone can pay you well over 400 bucks a month for 2 years and my debt to income ration has been the same for 15 mths of the loan due to homeownership now. Do you not think I would pay 367.00. You are just crooks in my eyes now. So much for  honoring your heroes.
"Kristen screwed me over after the recent death of my spouse.  They are holding ALL accounts, including POD's and will not payout just because we also held a home mortgage there, which is not in the rears.  The combination of ALL business with there is more than likely GREATER than a payoff would be anyway!!   I can only say I am very dissatisfied and have turned them over to my Legal experts.     Consumer Beware....do your banking elsewhere!"
"Made a reservation a week ahead. However, when I arrived at the location my rental was not available. I was told the previous customer still had it and they had no idea when it would be back. Very unprofessional and disappointing experience. Ruined my plan to move several items this weekend. Making it very inconvenient for me."
"Don't  Waste your time they will book you and when u go, switch around and tell u your shot out of luck, I would give it zero stars if I could."
"I love U-Haul and use them a couple times a month , every month. I have rented probably 30 pieces of equipment total. All equipment is excellent and a great value. That is except this time at this specific location. I rented a tow dolly as I have many times before. This dolly clearly had a bent wheel and was the most dangerous thing I have ever towed. Anything over 45mph felt like it was going to take my vehicle off the road. When everyone on the highway is going at least 60mph and I am doing 45 it is a clear safety hazard. But things happen in life, I get it. I made the most of it and when I returned my equipment I kindly asked for a store credit I can use for my next rental.They declined and said I must have caused the damage to the equipment. They claim the only way the trailer can vibrate is by me speeding or not using the correct ball. I could not travel at highway speeds and I am using their recommended ball from their store. The only process they had for checking the equipment for damage was, I kid you not, kicking the tires and calling it good. A bent wheel can be just a few THOUSANDTHS of an inch off and they claim they can judge that by giving it a look and kick.  I asked for my receipt back and left the location. I will certainly use U-Haul again. But I will never come back to this location."
Tina was horrible. I was waiting for a truck when a white gentlemen came in and wanted a trailer.  She decided to handle him first even though I was there at least 10 mins. before him.  Then I had to ask why she took him 1st. She didn't have an answer.  Sad girl.
Went here to get a trailer hitch. Four hours latter they finished and when I hook up the trailer most of the lights didn't work. Pull off the trunk panel and the the plug they tap into was not reinstalled.
The manager at this uhaul is a complete loser. Bring back Danny or some one that does not cry like a baby. Truth is this manager will bring down uhaul just like the toy store that is no longer with us. U haul needs to value return customers over the once every five year customer that only uses service when they move once every five years. Get a clue uhaul. Your going to lose your regular customers and not be able to pay your bills. Consider this a wake up call. Do not want to deal with a manager that cant handle business. To make a customer that rents multiple trucks every week that mad at you. Your losing it uhaul. Get a clue and drop the dead weight.
"VERY REDCUILS NO RESPECT AT ALL
WASTE OF TIME"
Very unpleasant experience. Don't go to this U-Haul find another one.
Going on one hour of waiting for a vehicle I reserved. Will not be returning to this location
They tried over charging me for mileage that I didn't use. And when questioned they couldn't provide an answer. Scam artist!
45 minutes in line with 3 people in front of me. U haul will never be used by me again. The people are friendly but still.
Never enough trucks in stock 😑

"My experience at the bank of 10815 Sunset, attended by the personal banker Tania Aguilar we told her that we wanted to close a savings account where we were, my wife, me and my son Peter and open another with the same amount of money but in the name of My wife Lourdes only and with my son and I as beneficiaries, she said that ""it could not be possible"" and that the three of us had to be present, we told her that our son is deployed in Minot AIR FORCE BASE in ND and he could not travel. I had another checking account with my RIP mom, I told her ""no"" to close the account, to take out my mom, she said she couldn't and that she had to close the whole account; to that account, my Social Security and my mother's SS money arrived (when she died 04/25/2029 I took the death certificate to the bank) and they took her out of the account, they had done in April I had that changing everything, my payments to credit cards, FPL Water, cable etc etc etc it took me two days to make all that change and go to social security to give them the new account number with a special form that Tania Aguilar gave me, they are very inept, and do not know the rules or obtuse that did not learn them; We went to see Mrs. Barbara Fernadez at the Bird and 97 Ave branch and she told us that they didn't help me at sunset, Barbara is an expert with more than 35 years, and she opened a savings account for my wife, she put my Son Peter and me as beneficiaries, she told us she was sorry for what happened to me, at the Sunset branch, my relationship with Wells Fargo is more than 25 years old, even the mortgage we financed with you, before it was much better, never, never, I should have come to this agency, again, Until never, inept, with no desire to help. Those are the people who ruin companies."

"I submitted an application for pre-adoption regarding a dog that clearly stated ""good with other dogs"" because I have 2 smaller dogs. The coordinator apparently reached out to my vet regarding my 2 small dogs and found out one of their vaccinations had just expired (in the middle of a pandemic, so I didn't realize) and proceeds to contact me telling me not only would they not allow me to adopt because my dog wasn't up to date on vaccinations, but also that they don't allow people with small dogs to adopt from them. Still not sure why all of our time was wasted calling my vet to tell me they wouldn't allow me to adopt with 2 small dogs. Pretty sure this place is not on the up and up. But also, super unprofessional. You're not trying to help dogs at all."

"**Update. The Unsafe Housing of Ft. Myers went to the apartment in SEPTEMBER 2017 and again to check work was done in DECEMBER 2017. STILL NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE.
We were living here for two weeks when our roof started leaking. We put in three work orders during the month of August. Nothing happened, nobody came to check it or anything and so the ceiling started dripping water. Then the mold began. We were living on our living room floor for a little over a month. Extremely disappointed and shocked how this was poorly handled. The price they offer is too good to be true, however cheap prices surely do come with cheap services. Corporate does a very, very terrible job. It doesn’t seem that they really care about how their residents are living. They must also have sewage problems because the sink and bathtub in the bathroom fill up and take forever to drain. Same goes for the toilet because it gets clogged constantly.
I would not recommend living here. It is such a shame that a quaint little neighborhood is so poorly taken care of."

Just google and see for yourself the thousands of articles siting how CBT therapy is USED to help children on the spectrum.

"The idiot manager who barely speaks the English language tries to do everything he can to get out of honoring a warranty, even if what he says make absolutely no sense. Not to mention the strange odor emitting from the rear of the location is enough to make one puke. Couple these two factors with the fact that their stock is worthless, already damaged product, and your in for a hell of a laugh/bad shopping experience. The 2 locations on Beach Blvd are probably the best pawn shops I've ever been to and there stock is pretty decent but this location is pretty much worthless and corporate should probably shut the place down and send the single brain cell having manager back to the Home Depot parking lot. If I could rate 0 stars I'd rate -1 place is a waste of a perfectly good store front. Beach blvd location honored the warranty ^^"

"Disappointed-
I used this company to Treat My Home for Termites  last week.
Here is My Fair and Honest Review-
The day before tenting I went to Publix Supermkt to buy 7 Sub Sandwiches and a 12 pack
of Bottle Water to offer the fellows whom will do the work in the heat on Tenting My Home.
I took the time to fill a cooler full of Ice to insure the water and Sanwiches would remain cool  when the workers arrived.
I did this as an Act of of Kindness as I Myself used to work on Hot Roofs in the summertime years ago.
I kinda feel kicked and disappointed and I will explain further-
They show-Up as Scheduled and seemed Very Friendly to me, They Spoke No English whatsover expect for the Leader named GUS.
GUS was the Only Person whom is allowed to enter the dwelling and is also known as the
*Gas Shooter*  whom injects the poison and is held responsible for the Keys to the property.
GUS was Down to Earth / Likeable / Friendly and Seemed Very Accomodating.

They Broke My Old Wooden Fence Gate (that was old to begin with) but I asked them NOT to force Open further )
They Pushed the Gas Hose thru bathroom window without loosening screen clamps, therfore Cracking / Bending the Aluminum Frame.
They Left Beer Bottles in My Back Yard  Carona & Heineken.
They Left Soda Cans and Plastic Water Bottles in My Yard.
..In Closing..
I Never Called and Complained About Any of This.
The Man Named Roger whom Comes Out to Every Structure Post Fumigation and Measures  For Any Remaining Gas Fumes Was  Humble and Very Friendly and Engaging with Information.
I Really Wanted To Tell Roger How Disappointed I was, But I didnt want to hurt his feelings.
I Just Spent  $2500 for Hotel Rooms / Fumigation & Food.
Respectfully Speaking, I Wish SPC Services LLC a Succesfull Future..
Sincerely..  Ron"

Never fill my prescriptions until I come in AND wait 45 minutes standing there. If I leave and come back I STILL have to wait another 45 minutes. They have NEVER filled or refilled my script unless I am standing right there. I've tried them 6 times since I moved here. They have gotten NO better. I'd rather stand in line at Wal-Mart.
Literally nothing takes place at this location! There are no activities for children it's not like a game room or any type of other activity. I've lived in Clewiston for 9 years now and went by there at least 10 times and they don't even have any information to give.
"Waiting for wife in my car ,somebody who had nothing to do,just went outside to my window ,knocked ,to tell me I was parked in her parking spot.So I moved to the one next to it,then she tooked her car form a few parking spots away to the one I was asked to move from.Might be  just this one lady who has nothing better to do ,but I will make sure not to return to this place ..again."
They wont let you park backwards. Why.

"My Mother had an appt to get tested for covid  due that she was exposed to a co-worker  with a positive test< my mother is having Symptoms  63 yo with  medical Issues  and at CVS on her appt time  they ask for a hard copy of her BCBS insurance  and She don't have it but she had her ID number .  they decline her because  of that and The "" RN "" said that she needs to call  her  Insurance and  wait until she get it  in order to be tested.( I get tested 2 days ago Without Insurance)  She also is a CVS Client. I am  Sure they have a copy. But no  they don't wanna have extra work .  Even with her insurance number and her Driver Lic. SO BAD  PeoPLE . Is she had the virus she will  be exposing  many person outside  I am A Nurse and that is no ok.  JUst  saying  NO GOOD"
VERY RUDE service at the drive thru window. Will NOT return to this branch.

No lo recomiendo."
"This store is under staffed and the Pharmacist is giving covid19 shots and prescriptions, this type of environment causes rushing  that can cause any amount of accidents as mistakes can happen. This is just unacceptable! My family member's physician sent her pain medication to this CVS in the AM hours. It's now 8:34PM and still no medication. My family member needed this medication in a timely matter due to severe deformation of a spinal column and excruciating pain. Not to mention that my family member is 75 yrs old. How can a profession that is supposed to aid it's customers be so ill prepared and incompetent!
It seems that the customer is their least priority.
How can this store be continued to operate in such a manner.

Also I am currently on hold with one of the Corporate customer service depts. and I have been on hold for 26 minutes and counting. This company seems to not really care about it's consumers..."
"I waited for about 15 minutes on hold while I was on line in the drive through then when turn came one of the people there I believe a pharmacy tech told me that she cannot help me because my medication was on hold that I I have to come inside the store to check the status of the prescription. Really? Very bad service, the first time that I am putting the prescription through them and this is the the great service no way this will be the last time. No way very poor pharmacy services."
"Wow unbelievable definitely no returning  i wake up this morning at 8 because my 5 month babygirl she's congested so she was grumpy i ran on my pijama with her to this CVS because its the closest to my house to get some baby tylenol and look for something that will make my babygirl feel better, while im in the medicine area i bent over to clean my babygirl runny nouse when i get up i have this security guy next to me pretending to be looking for something, i say good morning he ignored me completely so i keep looking for something for the congestion,  i was the only person in CVS. So i notice he was following me like i was going to steal something because i follow me through a couple hallway down to the humidifier section and he was right there in the corner. I'm a security supervisor in a hotel and i have never seen such a disrespectful way to treat a client with a sick baby, my only concern was to get something for my babygirl and i get treated like a criminal wow, been the only person in the CvS and no one even offered me any help. I'm definitely rather drive 15min to the nearest Walgreens than return to that CVS for nothing."
Had a prescription filled while I waited. Told me 15 min. 45 min later they say it has been ready. I was waiting there the whole time and no one told me. I haven't been to a CVS I like yet
I took a prescription to be filled the Pharmacy employee told me to come back as soon i get the text message and for my surprise pharmacy already closed and now im left with no medication for a severe back pain unbelievable very bad customer service
The staff in the pharmacy not friendly at all. Very rude attitude and I was just asking a question.
Nasty lady at the cash register. I asked if they price matched with Walgreens. She basically bit my head off. I was just asking!

"The measurements taken were wrong, two sides of the countertop were too short. I was willing to accommodate by having only the small piece replaced and let the other be. At first the seller try to give me fillers. Then seller told me he will be stopping by my house on a Monday but didn't show up nor call. The next day I called to follow up and the seller told me he will call me in 10 minutes, a week later I'm still waiting. I have now called my credit card to recall the last payment. At first they seem nice but not responding to their mistakes it's a huge issue. I do not recomend using them.

Almost two weeks after the above post, the salesman comes to my house to tell me that he's measurements were correct and that my cabinets are of the issue. Mind you, I have had this kitchen for over 5 years and the only reason I'm replacing the countertop was because the original had a crack that I did not like. The original countertops covered the entire thing perfectly so now he was trying to blame the installer of those cabinets for the work that he just did. Poor quality, poor ethics. Take your money elsewhere. They also run the business under a different name at a second location, be very careful."
I am disappointed in myself that I didnt see these comments before.  I am familiar with some of the complaints that are posted here. Lesson well learnt though. I would not recommended anyone here.

"This business is closing. Beautiful things, but a bit over priced."
"I used to buy and consign here a lot, but no more.  The staff are snobby and rude now."
