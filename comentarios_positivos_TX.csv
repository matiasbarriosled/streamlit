I live in the park next door to it but it's owned by the same man (Jimmy Holden). He is a good guy with very affordable rates. I'd 100% recommend it
I visit a very good friend of mine from time to time there and the little RV park is nicely kept the driveway through the park is not bad and it's pretty quiet around there for the most part if I had a RV I wouldn't mind living there at all
Very quiet and family oriented business. Great place for people coming in town for work. Very reasonable pricing and amenities.
"Hunter's RV Park is nice, quiet and clean. Every evening is a view of a beautiful sunset."
Clean place and staff great.
Quiet park. Clean.
Come stay with us when you are in town working. We are the working man's park!

"If you‚Äôve seen Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, some of you- especially those of you who have tried White Castle- may wonder why someone would go through so much for some sliders. If White Castle tasted anything like Golden Castle‚Äôs sliders, I would 100% understand. Golden Castle is amazing. I underwent a trek of my own to try it out and I have zero regrets. I ordered on-site and the wait was about 20 minutes (of course they take online orders) but it was totally worth the wait. $12 for six hefty sliders and an order of fries came out to be about $20 after tip. The 6 sliders could easily feed two people. I‚Äôm obsessed."
Had the sliders and onion rings for the first time. The sliders are rather addicting and a very good size (especially when comparing against chains). The onion rings were like having some at the fairgrounds. Cannot wait to go back and there‚Äôs a nice patio outside to eat if you want to eat and grab a drink from King Bees.
"They've developed an idea and made it their own, and expanding it pastrami brined hot dogs and Sichuan dry rub chicken nuggets. A little bit of work getting there, but worth it!"
So yummy! Hot and fresh!
"If there's better bar food than greasy sliders, I'd like to know what it is. I'm going to go out on a limb and say these sliders are noticeably better than the actual White Castle. Plus, since the cart is at the bar, you don't have to leave the bar to get them. Very convenient."

"Friendliness, clean, and comfortable. The workouts are awesome! Coach Greg is great at explaining the session exercises. There's no pressure. You can workout at your own pace. Not everyone is at the same level. But you still get a great workout!  Best place I found that fits my needs."
"This place has great fitness instructors, they're always in contact and motivating you. Their work outs are on point, challenging whole body and designed for all types of people. Highly recommend."
"Greg is the absolute best! You will get a great workout every time, guaranteed."
"Love love love these workouts, and the trainers! I've had gym memberships, and vfc personal trainers, but this place is perfect!  Small groups, great music, work at your own pace/ability. I've been going for a month and am already stronger!"
"I have been a member for two weeks now and I'm really loving this program! The workouts are great and exactly what I needed to get me back into a healthier lifestyle! Love the coaches energy and motivation, too. Support from our teammates is awesome! Best decision I could have made for my health!"
"From day one Coach Atlai and Coach Greg have been working with me on modification for my meniscus tear.  My fear was hurting myself  and not being able to workout at all.   Not only am I back at working out, my knee is stronger and I‚Äôve also managed to lose weight just being here little over a month.

I recommend this gym for any fitness level and/or age."
Glad to find a place that specializes in both nutrition and fitness. They have a very easy to follow plan and as long as you‚Äôre consistent and stick to their principles- you‚Äôll see results! Glad I found this place.
"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Coach Greg and Coach Atlai have been incredible throughout my journey. From meal plans, daily check ins online with my coaches, challenging fun workouts, this program is the perfect balance of motivation, accountability and inspiration. I've met some amazing ladies in my classes and we all encourage each other and keep things positive. I've lost 15 pounds and over 30 inches so far and I'm not stopping any time soon! Also,shout out to Roland who has also been very encouraging and has always been there for me when I needed advice or have had questions about the program. This place is the best!! Thank you!"
"I love love All Purpose Fitness. Greg is an excellent coach and the entire team has been very supportive.  Have met some wonderful, supportive ladies there. I'm in it for the long haul be cause I've got some goals to reach."
"I love All Purpose Fitness,the trainers are amazing and truly know what they are doing! I can't say enough about them,they care about what they do and they care about everyone that is a part of their gym. I highly recommend All Purpose Fitness!"
Fun and professional training! Great results when following the program.   I definitely recommend for those wanting to make a change in their life!
"STOP LOOKING, THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED YO BE. For the past few years i've struggled with looking and feeling my best. I've tried and failed many times on my own. A little over 3 weeks ago, I came across this gym. I decided to give it a try and Thank God i did. It has been by far the best decision I could have made for myself. The day of my consultation with Roland, I was blown away. Not only was he extremely professional, but the authenticity he exuded was crazy. I could tell right away that I made the right choice. The following week i began my workouts with Coach Gregg. He also exudes professionalism and passion, he makes us dig deep and work us out. If that isnt enough, the Ladies, the darn other ladies who are also there for the same reasons as me are extremely bomb. It's such a family like atmosphere, everyone is so encouraging and motivating. Can you imagine getting all of this while obtaining goals youve set forth for yourself? I couldn't either until I joined myself. They also help you with nutrition (meal plans), grocery list, group fitness, weekly workouts(w/ coach), accountability and so much more. So I say if you are looking for a place, look no further All Purpose Fitness is where you should be.."
"Been working out with Roland and the team here over a year and have had great results.  Very knowledgeable, professional and affordable.  Highly recommend."
I've tried differnt diets and excersizes by far this is the best fitness program I've done... I did lose the weight but just  not enough.    I wish I could have stayed on but just couldn't.
"Friendly, supportive and fun.  Hard work out that feels great!"

Had a great experience working with Melissa. We were trying to find out who had installed the wheel chair system for my fathers van and she was able to help us figure out what was going on. Thanks so much for the help!
"101 Mobility has been a lifesaver! They have helped us through problems with a lift and in getting a new lift when our old one was damaged. They were very fast and efficient in getting us the right lift and Alfred was a wizard at installing it. He had worked on our old one as well and kept it going when it had malfunctioned. Jennifer, Melissa, and the whole office staff were friendly,  kind, and empathetic.   The bottom line is always, ""did they do their job?"",  and  we can say they do a great job! I know the owner is always thinking about how to get the job done well and to the client's satisfaction. I highly recommend this company for your mobility needs. They carefully match your needs to the exact product and installation."
"Meeting the Challenges of Aging with 101Mobility

More than two years ago, I had knee replacement operations on both knees.  There were complications with the second knee replacement surgery that led to two follow-on surgeries.  Next was a lower back operation.  Even with frequent and diligent physical therapy, my mobility has since been severely compromised.

My wife of 56 years and I live in a two story house.  My reduced mobility confined me to the first floor and eventually led to a decision to either install a residential elevator or a chairlift system.  Because of the structure of our house, an elevator was not a practical option, so we began looking for a suitable chairlift system.  With the aid of the Google search engine, we found a company in the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex that seemed to have a good reputation for the design and installation of chairlift systems, so we signed an agreement to have one designed, manufactured and installed.  This turned out to be a HUGE mistake.

The company we chose for this project went through three manufacturing iterations and in each case the system components when brought to our house for installation did not fit together.  To this day, I don‚Äôt know if this was due to design mistakes or manufacturing quality problems.  The dealer for this dual rail chairlift system finally threw in the towel and refunded our substantial deposit, triggering our second, and thankfully, final search for an experienced and competent chairlift system dealer.  After another round of online research, we found Jennifer Raney and 101 Mobility.

Jen came to our home to assess our needs and to see the structure of our back stairs.   She then recommended the Bruno Elite Curve system.  Jen came a second time to complete the computer-aided design measurement process and subsequently,  our order was placed.  The installation was done after Thanksgiving by two installers from 101 Mobility.  The installation took about 3-¬Ω hours and was done with competence and meticulous care.  In comparison, the first dealer sent out a team of 4-5 people for each abortive installation attempt.

The entire 101 Mobility team was a pleasure to work with.  They are focused on making their customers happy by setting realistic, yet achievable schedule expectations and then meeting or beating those expectations.  As one of their happy customers, I can recommend 101  Mobility without any reservations.

Bruce Bourbon
Coppell, TX"
"Working with 101 Mobility has been a beautiful experience, their rep Christina was beyond knowledgeable. She helped my family and I understand the in's and out's of the stair lift and even educated us on a grant that we could look into (for our county).

I want to thank the 101 team for their time and hard work, I appreciate all that you have done for me to enjoy my independent living."
Harmar 601  Installed on our stairs.  Thanks for the great install Kirk and thanks for all the help Christina.

"Out of all the other places in lubbock that sell Hot Tubs, this is definitely the place to get one. They last a very long time and if something does go wrong they are quick and ready to help you out! I have had a hot tub with another company in town and if something broke down or I needed answers to a simple question they wouldn‚Äôt help me at all. But at Alcoe, I have had the best experience with them! Very glad I came to Alcoe! Very quick service. Really impressive. Definitely recommend coming to this place!"
"Great customer service!   My wife and I were planning on buying a hot tub at another store, but were blown away by the guys at Alcoe. They delivered our hot tub and went over every aspect of our new hot tub.  We have enjoyed our Sundance hot tub every day.  We would highly recommend using Alcoe."
"Everyone at Alcoe we‚Äôre wonderful! From helping us understand all the different options for our new hot tub, installation, and teaching us how to take care of it. They even had to lift the spa over our house to get it installed. They worked hard and fast and did an amazing job!!! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new hot tub!!!"
"If you are considering a hot tub, use Alcoe.
Brad and his team are excellent communicators and deliver excellent service. From the point of the sale to the install, it was very professional. These guys know what they are doing and do it very well. Ken did the install and was very knowledgeable of the product and very friendly on top of that. Stay away from brand X and use Alcoe. Excellent products and excellent service. The transaction and installation was seamless."
"Would just like to say that the gentlemen from Alcoe are great to work with!  My wife and I purchased one of their reconditioned Sundance Spas in October of 2018.  I've waited a year to write a review in order to give a full account of the purchasing experience and ongoing services.  The tub was like NEW and has been a life saver for my wife who has chronic pain issues in her neck and back.  When the tub was installed, they were able to get the job done in a very timely manner and were incredibly professional.  That level of service has continued over the past year when we have returned to purchase chemicals and other consumables and hardware for general preventative maintenance support.  They offer a superior line of products at fair prices.  While we were shopping for the Spa, they didn't play the typical sales games:  There were no gimmicks, no pushy sales people, no nonsense.  They are very knowledgeable, and were eager to educate us on the details involved with buying a Spa.  This was done more in the way of informing us on points of quality to look for in making this purchase and let the Sundance Spa sell itself on merit as opposed to giving us a hyped up sales pitch.  In regards to the product, the Sundance Spa is the best tub available in the Lubbock market.  The quality of construction is by far much better than the other tubs you'll find in other showrooms for the same if not higher price.  I am very satisfied with the exceptional service that Alcoe has provided and will continue to recommend them to my friends and family."
"After visiting pretty much every hot tub store in Lubbock, we decided to purchase or very first hot tub from Steven and Brad at Alcoe. What really impressed me was the level of professionalism, and the pride they took in their family business. When we were still in the decision-making process, Brad even came out to our home to look at potential spots for the hot tub, and to give advice on getting the electric run. During the month between when we ordered the hot tub and when it was delivered, we dropped in the showroom several more times to ask questions, and each time we were greeted with an air of professionalism and given their full attention to answer all our questions. One of the other things that really sold us on becoming an Alcoe customer was the fact that they never tried to up-sell us on any of their products. They listened to our wants/needs, made a suggestion, and we went from there. The whole process was very low stress!!"
Came in for a quick tea and OMG I loved it. I ordered the American hero and my twin got Hawaii 5-0 and sooo delicious. Highly recommend especially for energy. My tea energy rating is 9.8 highest rating I‚Äôve given for teas.
Went in for the first time. Staff was very nice and helpful. Had a delicious smoothie.
All of this for just $8! A full meal replacer shake with no sugar and only 10 carbs. Come visit Sabrina and Brenna!! You can even order it in advance and just pickup.

Lots of affordable delicious options and great service. I stopped in and ordered a bunch of things but definitely liked the leek rolls the most. I'd stop back in the future."
"Not your typical dim sum place! Some dishes hit while others missed. Very chill vibes with unique food delivery robot instead of the traditional dim sum cart. I think they‚Äôre trying to go for a more ‚Äúelevated‚Äù type of dim sum experience but I‚Äôd honestly go to Kirin Court or Golden Joy BBQ for a cheaper meal. Still a unique experience to try out though and I‚Äôd like to sample the rest of their menu at some point!

Dishes that hit: the Pan Fried Buns, Shrimp Ha Gao, and Beef Flat Noodles

Dishes that missed: Beef Shiumai (served with Worcestershire Sauce?) and Soup Dumplings (very bland)"
"This is absolutely the best Chinese I've had outside of the Asian districts. This is a blessing and I'm very picky with Cantonese/San Francisco style dishes. Their Dimsum is very fresh for being pre-order. What shock me was the dishes such as the Ho fun(dry flat noodles), salt & pepper shrimp and their water Spanish. I'll be here pretty much 2-3 times a week. They really take pride on their quality, the rice is top quality to their Finland Chau siu(bbq pork). You are missing out if you haven't ate here yet."
"We ordered the steam buns, pan fried buns, sesame chicken and beef chow ho-fen. It was all phenomenal and came out really quick. Staff was really friendly and helpful. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Amazing food. Loved it. Great service as well
I was at the soft opening and the food was very delicious. The service was great and food was very flavorful. I can't wait to return for the full menu.
It's finally open! Food was excellent. Will definitely be back.
"I don‚Äôt normally do this, but if you are in the Addison, TX (Dallas) area and looking for great Chinese food, you have to check out out Bushi Bushi Dim Sum! They are located at 4930 BeltLine Rd, Dallas, TX. The absolute best Chinese food I have had outside of NYC! Owner, Patrick, is a gem! He is from NYC where he owned 2 restaurants! Today was day 4 of opening. Food is authentic and delicious! Can‚Äôt find this quality of Dim Sum anywhere in Texas!"
"Food is SUPER fresh! I have done both takeout and dine-in here, and the service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended!"
"Great dumplings, reasonably priced and good service. We will be back!"
Absolutely the best dim sum in the metroplex! They are soft opening right now and they have a robot serving you your fare! The owner is exceptionally hospitable and Christina was amazing at suggestions. They are going to corner the market with their dim sum! Go there and just enjoy!
First time there yesterday. Had dinner - it was great! We will be back!
"So I'm a huge fan of Xaio Long Bao, and these are some of the best I've had.   I also tried an off menu item, the Jalape√±o & Bell Pepper Beef and the produce quality and freshness was impressive.

I'd highly recommend anyone west of the Toll Way hit this place up for their Dim Sum needs, as it's a great way to scratch this itch if you're closer to Addison than you are to Beltline and Greenville Rd."
"Finally, some good dim sum in Addison! We had the classic Shumai, soup dumplings (Xiao long bao), pan fried pork potstickers and the beef fried rice. Everything was amazing, freshly made and with high quality ingredients. We've had dim sum/dumplings all over DFW and this place just might take the cake. So excited to have them in the neighborhood, we'll be back ASAP!"

"The staff is amazing! Especially Angie
""These are great apartments in a great area. They are a bit older and that brings some issues nothing major but the maintenance and office staff are always friendly and quick to respond to such issues. I have loved my time here and will always recommend it to others."""
"I have lived here going on 11 months. The place is great. The parking is OK, but there roads could use some work. My only issue is that you have to use their utility company. The utilities are cheap, but whenever I get my bill, the price fluctuates but the meter reading stays the same. No one can tell me why. How do I know if I am actually using that dollar amount in utilities if the meter readings are the same each month. Location is good, but its hard getting on Preston Road in the mornings during the week. Depending on where you are in the  complex, UberEats, Lyft, Amazon, etc won't be able to find you. They always put my gps location at the CVS or the Dollar Tree."
The only thing I hate about these apartments. Is it doesn't have a drop box. So us people that work the hrs there open. We can't pay our rent. Guess they want us to pay a late charge or be late for our work.  So can you please put a drop box back up for your tenants that have to work for a living to pay this high rent.

"I will recommend them to everyone I know. They gained my full trust and respect today during my cleaning. My old dentist told me I had a dozen cavities and needed a dental implant. The doctor at Brazos Family told me the truth, no cavities or need for an implant. They saved me money and stress by not operating like a business. They are truly in practice for your dental health."
"Excellent service,  easy check-in. I  have used Brazos Family Dentistry for about ten years."
I've been a career customer of Dr. Billman for more than 10 years. She has done a fantastic job of helping me to keep all of my teeth with zero pain. The fact that she has a calm disposition and really small hands is a real plus.
What an all around great experience. The staff was very knowledgeable and caring.  Went above and beyond to get me in during these trying times. Their office is clean and welcoming.
"I am 60 years old and Dr. Ross and crew are the best dentists of my life.  So courteous and skilled and considerate of my individual needs.  I am blessed beyond measure to have these proactive folks looking out for my teeth.  If you are looking for a dentist, choose this guy.  You can't go wrong.  Tim C."
"Brazos Family Dentistry is an amazing place to go! They use technology to see exactly what needs attention in your mouth, then the doctors look and confirm what they see. Both Doctors are extremely nice and very helpful. And even better, all of their staff are extremely nice and amazing."
"I have been going to Dr. Ross for about 10 years. Now I refuse to go anywhere else! Great dentist, great employees, clean and capable working environment. Dr. Ross has done my braces, retainers, cleanings, and more and I have been very satisfied!"
Great dentists and staff.  Took time to show me everything and made me very comfortable.   Was wonderful at making me part of the treatment plan decisions and not just telling me what had to be done.  Gave me the information needed to make the right choices.
Everyone I met at the office was so nice. Kim & Dr Billman were awesome. Thank you for fixing my broken tooth Dr Billman. I can guarantee I will be back. And I will tell all my friends your office is the greatest! I would recommend Brazos Family Dential to everyone.
Great place. Everyone is so nice. Doctors and techs that understand that you can't afford everything at once sometimes
"Im Terrified of any dental work, but they made me feel assured and calm by being knowledgeable and answering all of my questions. Great people great service i would highly recommend."
"Always a great experience. In and out quick, always able to scheduled when needed. Great staff as well as great Dr""s."
"If I could rate ten stars I would. I have an insane fear of dentists. Dr. Billman is wonderful. All the staff is kind, courteous and very competent. I felt cared for by everyone I encountered."
"Dr. Ross and the entire staff are wonderful! Making an appointment is easy, there is little to no wait, and they work with you to find the best appointment time for your schedule. Great office!"
The office staff is amazing and so caring. They truly care about your dental health and do everything they can to stay updated as well as contribute to the community.
"Called the office on Friday after my cap came off and made an appointment for the following Tuesday! I arrived early for my appointment but was taken back to a treatment room before my appointment time, WOW! From door to door, we received excellent service. Dr. Billman and staff were extraordinary and the facility is very clean. They even called my insurance company to see if they will pay for a new cap, since my old one is damaged, to make sure that the plan of care does not put me over budget. I will definitely return for further dental treatment!"
Friendly staff. One of my better dentist visits without a doubt.
Very friendly made me feel very comfortable and did one hell of a job I would go back to them if I ever have to get a tooth pulled Dr.Ross Go hard in the paint lol
"Great and friendly staff, made me feel comfortable!"
"My daughter is getting her braces there and since day 1 we feel very comfortable, all the staff is friendly and professional. We definitely recommend this place for your dental needs. üòÄüëçüëå"
"The staff is very welcoming, and friendly! They are always ready to help in any way they can."
All workers here treat you like family!!
Always friendly service. Been a patient for years. Highly recommended!
"They are always friendly and helpful.
No one like the dentist, but my kids and I like the environment.  Thank you all"
Great dentist and always friendly.
So grateful to be a patient of Dr. Ross.  He and his staff are always comforting and really listen and care about me.
Excellent service and staff
"I think they are a very good dentist office because they are always wonderful with my special needs son Dalton Berkheimer, he always has a great visit."
Love it here! They are always willing to help!

A nice place  - their main focus is elderly or fixed income clients.  They do least to market rent clients also.  They are right down the street from the new Amazon building  - about 5 minutes away.  The apartment grounds are well maintained.  A very quiet place when I visited.
First of all I want to say that I have never seen any apartments as beautiful as these they are amazing and they have everything that a senior could ever need to make life a lot easier for us. I want to thank the receptionist I'm sorry I forgot your name but thank you for the tour today you are one of the most beautiful and amazing person and you definitely are made for the job you have. I was amazed by what I saw today I really can't believe I didn't know that we had something like this here in Waco or Hewitt.
Beautiful place but had so many problems after the storm
Great service from staff. Nice place to live.
I found this place for my mother. She really likes the place and the atmosphere.  I would recommend this place for senior citizen living.
I love the property it's very nice very warm and inviting
Nice apartments. Rent controlled.
Nice and quiet

The people who run the place are very cool and they have an awesome selection of games. They let me come in and use a table to play a card game for free. Definitely plan to rent a board game some time.
"Game Night used to be a comic shop, but now has adopted much more of a board game and Community type atmosphere. I Like It, generally, and I enjoy the people that I encounter there."
"Great local game store.
If your looking for comics they dont have any."
"Friendly enviroment with nice atmosphere. Talked DND with some people for a few hours and had myself a swell of a time. Anybody looking for a chill place to nerd out for awhile, this is the place."
"John was super nice and helpful. This is only a location for gaming, but worth it if that is what you are looking for."
"These people are great! Will be coming back many times in the future. The owner is good people, I would participate in anything he is involved with in the gaming community!"
Cozy spot to play regular or tournament games.
"Great little nerd shop, with a tight-knit community around it, with excellent management."
Great store! Runs awesome magic the gathering events.

"I am extremely please with this pawn shop. Yes their employees could be a bit more informed on customer relations, after all it's because of customer's  inventory that they have display cases.  Regardless ALI , they aren't responsible to keep up with your loans? YOU need to make the payments, keep up with your items. Why do you think they're responsible to nudge you with a reminder? Really grow up be responsible for your own stuff!"

"Alex and Letty are truly wonderful!!! Both friendly, personable and professional, all why processing your information in a timely manner. This was my second visit and will my only choice for future loan assistance. Alex always suggests great places for food and drink for when I travel back and forth from Dallas to Austin.

As far as rates go, they can‚Äôt be beat! When you take out a loan, you can rest assured it will be affordable to pay it back!

Thank you :) :)"
I needed a loan a few years ago and my sister recommended me to payment 1 financial on I-35 and Stassney Ln. I talked to Letty and she is wonderful. She explains all interest rates all payments everything you need to know. She also calls every now and then to make sure you are happy with the service. Or if you would like to refinance. I am happy with this location ! If you need a loan go talk to Letty and she will help you the best way she can!
"Payment one is a great place to go.  They helped me with my taxes and a great loan as well.   Talk to  Ms. Letty and Alex, Hercules.   Wondering staff."
Great ladies. Letty and Stephanie are so helpful.
"I have always had a good experience with Payment 1. The staff is very friendly, and is willing to work with you the best they can. I would definitely recommend."
Great customer service and very friendly. Payment 1 help me get the loan that i needed. Love this place.

"This man is truly talented!!
I received an arrangement for my birthday, it was breath taking!
Kyle was so nice.  It seemed to be a pleasure for him to see my smile when I
received my flowers. He was also so knowledgeable when I asked about the flowers.

I was so impressed that I used him on several occasions. (a couple of birthdays, a funeral, and a wreath made of silks)
You would be hard pressed to find another florist as talented, kind and helpful as
Kyle Robinson!"
My husband exclusively buys my flowers from here because Kyle is an artist and it shows! Every arrangement I have gotten has been so beautiful!  100% recommend this place and would never go anywhere else!!!
"The way it was for me welcoming and got to leave with a
smile even in the stormy day give it a 10."

The professionalism and knowledge shared by Matt Smothers during the usually hectic process was calming and greatly appreciated. Definitely will be returning on my next home purchase. Couldn't appreciate it enough.
"I have to give props to the team at DHI mortgage especially to Jason my loan officer and Rick my loan processor. Buying your first home is so stressful and they made the process as stress-free as possible, they where extremely professional and they are super busy all the time but still managed to get back with me via email or phone every time, I was never in the dark to what was going on. Would recommend them over any other lender."
"Everyone that works here is very friendly but sometimes overworked and in my case, I was overlooked in the waiting area and cost me an extra hour during my closing process."

"Awesome Gentleman, very kind and welcoming, we should all go there."
"Even though the gentleman that helped us did not seem well trained, he remained courteous and professional. The young lady was very eoe's which made the extra time spent worth while."
I have to leave a great review because the service was great!! I switched from at&t that was charging me 230 for 2 lines to metro for 120 for 4 lines! I mean its a great deal plus I got 4 phones. The sales guy was great did everything to help me and while I was there he helped other customers as well that are loyal to that location. I would recommend this location in a heartbeat.
"ETA: I'm stunned to report that the manager who overheard some of his employee's remarks tracked me down to apologize.  He left me a message before I had even posted this review (below), so it was all the more impressive.  I'm speechless. I've never been treated with such respect by a company rep, that even though he knew he had lost our sale, he wanted to apologize.  These days, it seems like nobody wants to say sorry or admit fault. I greatly admire his  courteous, ethical behavior.  I'm adjusting my rating accordingly.

Original Review: I stopped by the store to inquire as to what would be involved in switching to their company.  The young woman manning the counter was rather abrasive and rude.  She came across as though she thought I was going to argue with her, so she was Standing Firm and Being Decisive and Not Giving Ground, or some such nonsense.  She focused on whether or not I'd qualify for a promotion, which I had not asked about and thus had no reason to debate, even if I were the type to start random fights.   It took forever to get her to return to the question I had been asking since I arrived:  What is involved in switching to Metro PCS? She finally gave me a very vague, partial answer.  It became plain that she viewed my visit as an annoyance, so I gave up and left."
Great customer service! Rick was awesome and very helpful!
Really nice service and great deals on accessories. I love this place!!!

I recently enrolled my daughter in their program and she really enjoys it. She looks forward to gymnastics every week. She loves her teacher Mr. Jacob. The gym itself is clean and the equipment doesn't look misused or old. I look forward to my daughter continuing to attend this academy and seeing her progress.
"my daughter has gone here for 8 months and we love this place the teachers are great with new students and they feel welcome. my daughter loves here teacher and she looks forward to going here every Thursday. its always clean and the staff is always nice and willing to answer all the questions that you may have and are very well trained. they have a seating area right in front and have a tv for the training that goes on in the back so you can keep up with what your child is doing in class.We love SGA and recommend it to all my daughters friends, plus the prices here are reasonably priced for exceptional service and training. come and bring your child they have a free trial class you will love it here ."

"We called Bill of Georgetown Dryer Vent Service to clean our dryer vent that had not been professionally cleaned since before we moved in to our house 9 years ago (or ever).  Our vent was packed with lint and he cleaned it all out, including going in from the attic and negotiating unexpected turns and curves in the vent at the bottom.  He was on time, wore a mask, was vaccinated, worked quickly, and his price was very reasonable.  We will use him again!"
"We recently had our dryer vent cleaned by Bill Treadway's Georgetown Dryer Vent Service. We are very glad we chose Bill. We would not have been able to clean it ourselves. Our dryer vent extends to the roof and it was hard for us to get behind the dryer but not for Bill. He moved the dryer and found that the duct behind it had a tear. He replaced it and vacuumed the entire vent up to the roof. He was prompt , courteous, put it all back in place and cleaned up everything at a reasonable price.  We feel much better about our dryer now. Dryer vents that extend to the roof need periodic cleaning or they will stop up and can cause a fire. We will definitely use Georgetown Dryer Vent Service again."
"I had my dryer vent serviced for the first time since moving to our home in Georgetown and I can‚Äôt say enough about how awesome the service and experience was with Bill. Very professional, friendly, honest, and personable. He did and excellent and thorough job at a very fair price and I‚Äôm very pleased with the service we received.
I highly recommend Bill and his company for this service (an important service that a lot of folks don‚Äôt usually think about). Such a small thing to ensure the safety of preventing a fire hazard. Well done Bill! :)"
"Great service, reasonable price."
He did a great job!  I would highly recommend this business to your friends and family.
Quick Affordable Service.
"If i could give 6 stars, I would.  Bill was fantastic.  Showed up at the agreed upon time, did everything he said he would, and left the house cleaner than he found it.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for dryer vent servicing"
"Jane will work for you and help guide you with all your insurance needs ! I was sold when she could not beat our current price for a business quote she made some recommendations and graciously told us the truth that she couldn‚Äôt beat our current policy. For this I still chose to do business with her with our personal home and highly recommend Infinity Insurance for all your insurance needs. I love that she will call , email and text you to save you time, keep you safe and get a policy issued to you !"

"Even though we had alot, their wings are some of the best I have ever had. They were awesome. Must try! Service was great and management came by to check on us several times to make sure everything was up to expectations. The family and I will definitely be back by soon!"
"After party burger and Baja fish tacos were amazing! Friendly staff, nice atmosphere."
Great Rotisserie Chicken. Great atmosphere. Great friendly Service. Could improve on their wings but the choice of flavors makes up for it. The Charro beans are out of this world. Highly recommended. The bar is fabulous. I would  go again. This place is like a hidden place but sure to please you.
"Will be back to try other items. Food was good, came out hot and prompt. Service was on point.

Items ordered:
chicken fried chicken with a side of okra( cfc was okay, but the fried okra was really good especially when you get a fried pickle or two in there).
Rooster combo had rostierrie chicken over dirty rice and chicken stripes with fries ( rostierrie üêî was good the rice was as well, fries were pretty good skin on, and the stripes were like the cfc just okay).
Side of 7 wings ( size of the wings were perfect and cooked perfectly and the flavors were also perfect  - mango habanero and hot)"
Provably gonna make this a weekly stop. Great food. Great service even when busy. Awesome place.
Staff was so helpful and kind!! Loved the office.
"I've been seeing him for 11 years now and has had the same receptionist, nurse,  and MA, that to me says a lot. He always listens to my concerns and offered solutions. He delivered my baby in 2013, thank you Dr. De La Rosa!"
"I absolutely love this place! I felt with John who was amazing and very professional! Called me to let me know they were in the area for drop off and pick up, made sure we had exactly what we wanted (ninja turtles). It made my son's day so special! Thank you quality jump and thank you John for making everything so perfect!"
Good customer service! Price was fair.  Delivery and pick up was prompt. The bounce house worked well. Definitely would use them again.
"Called in a last minute request on a Friday to see if they had a bounce house available for Saturday. They were super accommodating and the price was extremely reasonable! I also ended up calling back later to add on chairs and a table and they were able to accommodate that as well. They were flexible on pickup times which I appreciated, as it allowed us to truly get alot of bang for our buck.

The crew that came out to drop off and pick up were extremely quick and courteous. We rented the Mickey House unit and would highly recommend it. All of our guests loved it.. And our family members agreed that the price was very reasonable. Lastly, one major reasons I believe they provide 5 star service is because they call you and give you a 10-15 minute notice as to when the crew will be there for dropoff and pickup.

Will definitely use Quality Jump in the future when I need a bounce house and highly recommend them!"
Quality Jump is awesome. They are friendly and professional and we use them for all of our rentals. I highly recommend them for all your party needs!!
"Best place to get bounce house rentals. Friendly staff and people, and great selection. They are the ones to call."
"While I'd been trying to clean the pool myself all spring, my husband finally convinced me to go with a service, so I could focus on swimming in the pool instead! (I know I know...but I didn't realize how much work it was!). While we pay a tiiiiny bit more for Pirate Island Pools, we both agree the extra few dollars are really worth it! The pool looks amazing, cleanings are always on time, if anything big needs to be replaced they show us what they're looking at before-hand, the servicemen are polite and knowledgeable and the office is always responsive. We couldn't be happier! :D"
They did a great job on our pool. They were very helpful in advising the proper service plan for general maintenance. I would highly recommend!
Great folks and really nice ladies in the office..
"After trying many different pool companies with no success, we tried Pirate Island Pools.  They were exactly what we needed.  They finally got our pool clear and beautiful.  They have been faithful in coming out each week.  All of their employees are polite, friendly, and willing to answer any questions you may have.  I would recommend them to all of my friends!"

"Thank you Astrid and Ally for making my little boy‚Äôs first daycare experience a memorable one.  Thank you for making us feel like ‚Äúfamily‚Äù versus another client in understanding and anticipating our needs.  For me, finding the right daycare wasn‚Äôt only where my kid felt comfortable but also making me feel confident in knowing my baby was safe while I was away.

You guys rock!"
Absolutely love this place!! The staff is attentive and loving. They over communicate with parents. My son is all smiles when I pick him up. Great place for your kiddos.
"We have been with them a year and half now, and it has been a wonderful experience so far. We feel very safe and comfortable with our child here."
"I toured many facilities in hopes of finding the perfect childcare for my twin baby girls. My quest ended when we found Children's Lighthouse. We were greeted by Sherri who made us feel so welcome. The facility is just amazing and the staff were all so friendly and inviting. Sherri helped to make our decision easy. She toured us into each room introducing us to all the teachers. Sherri even followed up with us the very next day thanking us for considering Children's Lighthouse, something no other facility we visited did.  Children's lighthouse stands apart from the rest with its wonderful staff, the very clean facility, and the welcoming overall environment. So happy to have found them."
So not sure why there are negative experiences with this location because the whole year we have had nothing but a great experience. My little girl was going here for Pre-K and the teacher was so good with the kids. It might not seem like much but they send daily photos and once a week a video of show and tell. It was awesome watching my daughter grow throughout the year with these photos and videos. When she first started she new some things but you can definitely tell she learned so much towards the end of the year. The staff at the front were very nice to my wife and always inviting. The pricing I thought was very reasonable for all my daughter received and all the staff does for the children. We really have nothing negative to say. The owner also watches over her staff very well to make sure they all provide a good service. If you are looking for a place that you can feel safe to leave you children and learn as much as possible this is the place for you.
"All three of my children attended Lighthouse, it is the best pre-school in the area."
Couldn't ask for a better place for our three boys. Wonderful staff and amazing curriculum.

"Dr. Amaro is the best. If you are in his care, you will be in good hands. His nurses were great, too! He is very professional and kind as well! I strongly recommend him. but not the staff working for the facility. That staff does not know anything about medical billing and customer service."
"Had a colonoscopy with Dr Amaro, everyone of his staff members are amazing, cordial and caring."
"I recently had my colonoscopy done at this location with Dr Rafael. Highly highly recommend him. The procedure was seamless, instructions were clear and no pain/side effects after it."
"When you need a real Doctor, not those who are looking $$$$$, you need to look for a Latino person. In my case always work. Dr Amaro has been the best for my illness. Super nice, profesional, HUMAN. Highly recommended!!"
"For having my first colonoscopy, the personal where Great. They made me feel relaxed ( before the drugs). They all where professional. Hopefully, I never have to visit them, until another 5 to 6 years. So if anyone is in need of testing. They get my vote and I, highly recommend Hill Country Endoscopy Center."
"One of the best gastroenterologist in Cedar Park, he's well knowledgeable in his field of practice and has great bedside members."
Dr. Amaro is professional and personable. He listened to everything I had to say and took time to answer questions. I wish all doctors were like him. I felt very reassured that he had my best interest at heart.
Everyone up there is amazing. They genuinely care and listen to any concerns. I'm so greatful to Dr. Amaro and everyone at this clinic. Thank y'all for being so supportive!
"The Dr. Amaro and his staff are great!  Respectful, careful, and communicative!  Highly recommended!"
"Dr. Amaro is fantastic.  I love that his clinic is not part of one of the huge medical systems that runs patients through like cattle.  My son received fast appointments, genuine care and concern, and excellent medical care.  Our insurance is forcing us to switch Drs but Dr. Amaro and his staff have worked hard to connect us to another good GI doc on our plan.  We sad to change, but I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Amaro and TDD in Cedar Park."

"Dr. Olson and team are amazing. Not only is she an amazing dentist, but they are kind and considerate. Highly recommend them!"
"A great place to have my choppers cleaned! The staff is kind, courteous and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Eastridge Dental for keeping your pearly whites taken care of!"
"Staff is always friendly and polite. Very little wait time. Primarily Dr Laura Olson was the dentist but they recently added a new doctor...Walker(?) who was also very professional. I've recommend to family and friends...even though I'm told she has ties to Texas A&M.
Hook 'Em Horns!"
You are greeted with a smile and will experience the greatest Dental treatment from the Dr.s and Dental technicians.  You will absolutely look forward to returning to your next visit.
For 40 years I was not fond of going to the dentist. The staff and dr Olsen  are so pleasant and attentive to my nervousness. I am relaxed going here and do not mind semiannual visits.
Been going here for over 10 years. Great staff and customer service!
Very good service. No wait when you have appointment. All staff is courteous.
"I am a self proclaimed wuss when it comes to having dental work done. I cracked a tooth and was told by friends to go see Dr Laura Olson. I am so glad I did. She did an amazing job, put me at ease and made me feel like family. Highly recommend!"
Great dentist and staff.  Could not ask for better!!

"Sharita is the best!!! After having two bad experiences with stylists in Dallas, I am so glad I found her. She goes above and beyond to make sure her clients have the best experience. She is very light handed and gives the best scalp massages. I always leave her shop feeling like I received top notch service. Thanks Sharita!"
"Top notch hair care specialist coupled with a delightful personality. I'm incredibly particular about the process from start to finish, today was my first visit with Sharita there's no need to continue my search, she's a rare find. If i could add 5 more stars she deserves it. Excellent experience! I highly recommend."
"I moved from Detroit a few years ago, searched everywhere for a beautician and had some terrible experiences. When I found Sharita she had me hooked from day 1. She really cares about your hair and the products she uses is like fertilizer on my hair. Extra bonus, I'm not sitting in the shop all day. Awesome Stylist, hands down."
"When you find a stylist that cares for the health of your hair AND will have you SLAYED... Keep them!
Thee Best Natural hair stylist I've had by far for straight styles!"
Had all my needs covered.
"My son has been going to First Class Academy since he was 1 and he is now 8. As a new mom I was every hesitant about daycare. We have felt at home since day one. I can not be more blessed and thankful that my son goes here. Thank you Ms. Kerry, Ms. Angela, Mrs. Kesha, Ms. Alexis for taking care of my son."
"I was a little hesitant about putting my baby in a daycare center, but when I visited this center it just felt right it was clean and the infant one room was neat and very inviting. My child has been here for 3 months now and we absoulty love it."
My son has been going here for several years and we have had nothing but great experiences.  My neighbors have had their children go here as well.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.
Very friendly staff and home-like feel!
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!! From the first day to the last day. Everyone has been so helpful. The only reason I had to take my son out was because my Job transferred me, so it was out of my way. I want to thank all the staff for just being awesome. Mrs Mosley the director was just amazing. Always so helpful. Everyone there is just a big family and that's what I loved.  That's one the biggest reasons I think that my son loved coming. even on Saturdays and Sundays my toddler would cry because we wanted to come to school. Until this day he still remembers his all time favorite teacher. And time we will to eat a restaurant that's near but and he thinks that we are going to school. Thank you guys for always helping and being there for not only my son but for me as well."

Very good church and they're a few times really enjoyed it.
This is a great and friendly  place to worship  and hang with like minded brothers and sisters of Christ.
"Spirit filled Christian's loving Jesus & each other. Reminded me of the 1st Century Church ""The Way"""
Words don't really describe Neon Life Church and people. My suggestion would be to experience it for yourself. 9:30 if you want to get a jump start on your day and 11:00 if you want to enjoy your coffee a little more. It's a fantastic way to start the week!
I really enjoyed visiting today
Wonderful place to be.  Great worship team and always great sermons.  Highly recommend!
"I haven't met the owner who seems to be the source of all the bad reviews, but the two ladies behind the counter right now were as pleasant as I ever expect from a convenience store. Bathroom isn't the cleanest, but other than that, nothing seriously wrong with this place at all. Hopefully the owner will learn some customer service/people skills from his employees."
"The place is clean and always has fresh food daily. The customer service is excellent and the lines move fast, in and out.. Dont forget to get tha lotto !!WHAAAAAAAAAMMMMM!!!"

"An eye exam is something you can find yourself putting off, but at Luke Eye Associates both Doctors are very kind and make you feel very comfortable.  This was my second time to go to Dr. Luke and my husbands first time.  The staff is very friendly. I think you will be glad you choose this clinic.  Their equipment is very high tech. They have a large selection of frames and the lady that fitted our glasses was fantastic."

She also knows how to build a strong rapport with all of her clients and she really pays attention to the things y'all talk about. When we lived in the DFW area, we would travel back to Midland just for her to cut our hair! It was def worth it and still is!!"

Dr. Burrows a a wonderful doctor. Amber Downes his PA is also wonderful ! They have a very nice office staff as well. They really care about their patients.

"I had a sizzling arcing sound out of my panel on a Sunday. Tony got here very fast and had my issue resolved in plenty of time to get me back to the pool. Very professional, great work, knowledgeable and informative. I'll definitely work with Tony and Mister Sparky again."
Thank you so much for everything!!!  Service was great!!
"We had an electrical emergency & had no idea who to use. After a little searching I settled on Mr.Sparky & I am SO glad we did. I called late in the evening & they were able to schedule an appointment for the next morning between 8 & 10am. The person who handled the scheduling was super helpful & courteous. Andrew arrived right around 8am. They sent his picture before arrival which was a nice security touch. He was quick, friendly & very explanatory. Electrical work is not cheap, ever, but he was able to find the main cause of our problems & fix them immediately & he pointed out another issue we were unaware of but let us know it wasn't an immediate concern so we could schedule it a little later to spread out the unexpected expense. That was extremely helpful & appreciated. Our overall experience was extremely positive & I would recommend this company & this electrician (Andrew) to anyone!! When dealing with a nightmare of a situation, this kind of service can make all the difference in the world. Definitely 5 ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ's!"
Albert was very professional and answered some questions that we had.  Great Job
Very professional team. Their work and products used were of high quality.
"Everything  was great. He told  us he p0p0pmpk0k9j9k9mwas

He then gave prices and then we was given options  of doing then or later
Great job.  Great  job. Thanks."
"From Start To Finish, Mr Sparky Fort Worth was amazing!  Stephanie got us scheduled and When David came out he was professional, courteous, informative and knew what he was doing! He diagnosed the issue and got all he had to do, done quickly and efficiently. Love Mr. Sparky Electric in Fort Worth..Will Be Using them again! Thanks Mr. Sparky!"
"Dustin arrived on time. He is knowledgeable, courteous and professional. He pointed out problems as well as installations that are correct. He answered all of our questions. Good man."

"Dustin arrived on time, detailed how much I would expect to pay and completed the job quickly. His diagnostics were spot-on and he pointed out things I had missed, and was very informative."

"Best place to get all your devices taken care of. Have brought my kid's tablets to get their screen replaced multiple times.  They are always friendly, helpful, and prompt. Got my 2 tablets replaced within 2 hours. Thanks again for your great service!!"
"I brought my phone to have it fixed. I dropped my phone and the LCD is messed up. The gentleman at the store was friendly and professional and he set my expectation right when he said it‚Äôll take 30min to fix and I can wait if I want to. I waited and it took less than 30min. He gave me a 90-day warranty and was very clear on what the warranty covers. I didn‚Äôt expect to pay so much. It cost me $80 and I was hoping for $50-60. But because of the customer service I was ok with the price. I hope they did a great job. I will write an updated review about the quality of work/repair in a couple of weeks. Let‚Äôs see how my phone functions now that it‚Äôs fixed. If you need to have your phones fixed, I still highly recommend Smart Phone Medic in Edinburg."
"Good customer service. Friendly and helpful. Changed the broken screen to my Iphone 6 in about 10 minutes. I was surprised of how fast they work and the results were amazing! Also, I found it less expensive here than similar repair shops down tenth st in McAllen."
