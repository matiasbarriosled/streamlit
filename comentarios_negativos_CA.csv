Bad service

"I would compare my experience with this store to buying paint from Walmart.  You will have to help yourself until you bother an employee for assistance, only to realize that the employee probably has little to no experience with paint.  I was able to look past the poor customers service because some of our friends had mentioned a few colors from Dunn-Edwards.  We were finishing up a project and I stopped by to grab some swatches, but they had already locked the doors.  It was 12:55 PM according to my iPhone, a very accurate time.  The employee standing there, probably the one who had locked the door, would not turn his head.  I would have been in the store 3 minutes prior, but I had to drive around to find parking because they've marked off about 10 empty spots in the front of their store for ""employees only"".  As I walked to my car, I noticed employees walking out of the back and hopping in their cars, parked in the unmarked spots.  Next time, I'll just go to Lowes.  They carry better paint anyways (Sherwin Williams)."
"Omg it is really filthy there. I know for sure they don't change their sheets. When i got off the table she dust off the table with her hand. They are old and unattractive. Whatever happy thoughts you thought you might get, it is not worth it!!!!! Coming from a guy, believe me it is not worth it."
It would be nice if the person answering the phone spoke English. Total waste of time.
Argued with me over a tip made me feel very uncomfortable I would not recommend this establishment
She was really rough and demanded a tip! Who demands a tip? 40 bucks for an hour is cheap but you get what you pay for.

"My first and last massage at this place period. What a disappointment.  I would only recommend this place to someone who likes being pushed into the table repeatedly for 20 min followed by a 5 min of nervous rubbing or whatever and 5 min of hot towels.
- Rushed, inexperienced and greedy."
"More of a light body rub than a massage
Wont be back

It was clean and people were nice, but I almost asked for my money back bc what I recieved wasnt a massage. Massage chairs have more of an effect than what I recieved."
Meh.
I showed up at the 10:30 morning service  around 10:20 . Not one person treated me when I got there. Sad. I sat down it felt uncomfortable during worship. I googled for a mother church for another church and left.
"Took my grandma and myself to do a manicure and a pedicure. I clip my nails and grow them so all I was looking for was a quick trim and buff. I felt like I constantly had to correct her on the clipping as one side obviously looked rounded and the other squared. Just seems like it shouldn't be a detail to miss. I mean who doesn't want their nails to look even? As for my grandmother she had her toes done and the associate who did them accidently hit the fresh paint on the big toe and ""fixed"" it. Looked terrible. If you take a chunk out just remove the nail polish and start over for an even coat. Very disappointing as this should be some basic 101 skills."
"Worst place, slow and they don‚Äôt know what the hell they‚Äôre doing. Maybe next time don‚Äôt lie to get people in your chair. I look like my 5 year old did my nailsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
They boy did not come back out right .. my mother in law took him in ... The haircut looked like one of those bowl cuts ... 13 bucks that ill never see again and the boy maybe scarred for life ... try at your own expense.
We waited for them to open for 30mins.  The owners were late and then when they opened up they said they open at 10am instead of the advertised 9am.  Customer service is bad and because of the cheep packaging they charge more for their beads.  Not worth the trip.  They also make you not only wear a mask to get in but you have to wear gloves too.  Such rude people.  In this picture they are open and have an open sign out but are not letting people in.  Seems like they do what ever they want and do not care for customers
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
Very rude people. They are really rude representatives.
It's ridiculous the way they treat walk-in buyers...
customers MUST be treated with respect... are you agree?
If the store's owner read this review make sure your customers don't get bad experiences from your employees, Specifically from the angry cashier person.
I am NOT going back to this store.
Nice Store but It's not worth it..."
"Horrible customer service..
The man is soo rude..
The store is  nice."
"Believe what is said about the service ... These people are impatient and seems as though they have some issues with certain types of shoppers. I came looking for beads i have listed. But I was treated as If I was being difficult. NO Customer service here what's so ever... This is my 2nd Visit and on both occasions it was clear they had decided on a sterotype of me not purchasing even though I held $300 in my hand the whole.entire time to assure them ...

It is so sad when this happens
Its clear they do not need walk in customers
Possibly survive from bulk sales. And that awesome

But, DO NOT GO HERE if you are using beads for Rehki... The ENERGY WONT SUFFICE."

Everyone at this salon has no skills to deal with customers they all have a face like ugggg, specially the young lady I haven't seen for months, that lady needs to switch careers she is definitely not friendly at all! And Ely wants to charge everyone different, she doesn't have a set price$. Definitely will not be stepping foot at this horrible and dirty place..

"The receptionists are the most incompetent, unorganized & deviod of common since people I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with in 45 years! They failed to tell me to bring coins for parking; or that parking is limited to only 2 hrs; or that I needed to call them upon arrival to be let into the bld. I stood outside for 15 mins in the HEAT waiting to be let in. Further, they never bothered to check ( at the time I scheduled my appointment over the phone) to make sure I had an up-to-date referral for my ""Worker's Comp'"" case. So, I traveled 45 mi's round trip, & 120 mins drive FOR NOTHING!!! I only gave them 1 star because Google won't allow less. They deserve -5 stars. These people are idiots. Some people should be restricted to working at Mc Donald's!!!"

"It was very bad experience with  Acuity eye group . After i called them and gave them all the information to scudual appointment and confirmed and waiting for more than week then i shocked that there was nothing on their system for my appointment in the day  of my appointment. They wanna reschedule again for another appointment  but I don't , because i don't trust them any more . They wasted my time and affect on my eye negatively.  They have to  fix and reform scudual calling system and don't waste patient time ."
Worst place for online business. Place an order online took them 4 different attempts to make my canves each time art work was trashed due to flaws in the printer( smudges every where not clear). Finally I went in spoke with Kristen from customer service and got it done. Seems like this people are only in it for the money and not the customer. Becuase they do not put themself in customers shoes when doing the work and just sending anything out just to beat the dead line but hey free shipping what can i say
"Worst customer service, went from great place to worst then talking to a robot"
The Customer Service in front is terrible.

"Went to laptop masters for the first time over a year ago but a different guy was working there. The first time I went there a different guy fixed my laptop and it was working good for about 7 months then it stopped working. I took it back to laptop masters but the same guy doesn't seem to work there anymore.
I was told my ports were burned out and that i needed a new motherboard. I was charged 200 bucks. The ports are still out and therefore I recieved no new motherboard. I think I was ripped off and Im not sure why. I thought i could trust this service but its obvious I can not. The new people working there don't seem as trustworthy. Go elsewhere if you can."
"The entire process is sketch. Nowhere online does it state that I have to stay in my car, so my first impression is having an oversized security guard yelling for no reason. I found this slightly disrespectful, but more of an unorganized ordeal. The ""tender"" is more of a cashier that has to make multiple trips inside and out. First to verify your Id, then take your money, then finally they come back with your order. For a place titled ""express"" I've had faster service from other Haven locations downtown. Prices are the only decent thing I found satisfying."
This place is ok its almost a good place tho but the flower is really extremely too dry to be that expensive an 8th for 100.00 bucks should never be that dry they gave me the wrong 14grams when I asked for 14grams of a different product the was a higher thc potency which was my fault for not checking the bag b4 I drove 10hrs back home üò† I hope yaw get some better prices soon tho....

". Unfortunately this Denist was recommended to me, omg I was shocked at the lack of cleanliness there. As there was even someone‚Äôs blood on one of the tools she was going use on me. Needless to say, I walked out without letting them work on me. Totally unacceptable practice, during these uncertain times we‚Äôre all trying to be safe and clean as possible. This Denist and her assistant extremely unprofessional before I walked out, she stopped what she was doing the Denist 3 different times to go answer the telephone not changing her gloves after doing so. If you‚Äôre looking for unsanitary conditions then this is the Dentist for you, if you‚Äôre looking for clean and professional this is absolutely not the Dentist for you."
"The office is not organized and clean and dr is not working clean specially during Covid situation it was scary to be there, she made denture for my mom that wasn't fit at all and my mom could not even talk after using it but she was keep grinding the denture, she is nice in face but doesn't have professional skills to help out the patient."

Cheap prices but you get what you pay for. They left my windows filthy after removing tint and didn't even bother to wipe them down what so ever. Normally this wouldnt be to big of a deal but I just washed my car and didn't have to to get it cleaned again.

"Students and staff of UCLA avoid university housing at all costs! It's run by crooks, thieves, and terrible people. They give zero care about human life or safety. Elevators get stuck and have issues non stop, and are FIVE YEARS PAST THEIR INSPECTION DATE. If you're in a wheelchair prepare to just not have access to your home at times. The repairs are slow and sloppy. Air condition units out for weeks on end (not unit, UNITS, because they have unsafe and outdated power delivery to the building, which blew out many residents units at once, in the winter.... Not even under heavy load), with zero ETA for fixes..... Why? Because they use student labor as a front for everything! Any complaint you make, any request you have, goes to an underpaid student, that gets no support for UCLA itself. The owners should be arrested or at the very least banned from building ownership ever again. This is unforgivable and I have no idea how they sleep at night, gouging students and staff day after day and can't even do BASIC ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.

Oh and the stairs are broken for months. No eta for that.

Rusted and broken railing laying on the ground for years.... No eta to fix that.

Pool that is never cleaned. After a year of waiting and finally asking we were told it ""should be cleaned daily"". Now it seems like it gets at least bi-annual cleaning.

Gym room with broken equipment. The room was redone too a couple years ago, but the broken machines were left in place.

Car garage that has many thefts every year from poor security, including thefts of locked bikes.

The list would go on but I've only so much time. These crooks need to be punished, and I feel so bad for all the students and staff that keep having to put up with this."
I do not recommend this place full of racist people who frequent this place everyday it's not a place you want to raise kids in if they are black or biracial or if they don't think you are in the same tax bracket as they are they treat you as less of a human

"DO NOT COME HERE! STAY AWAY! If I could give this ""business"" a ZERO STAR review, I would gladly do it. So i arrived here at around 5:20 PM or so, the owner Jose tried to get me to get a haircut by the elderly lady at the chair by the entrance. I told him that I was going to wait for one of the men that cut hair, either the guy next to him; or himself. He un-professionally told me ""okay well I got 2 appointments, so there's 2 people ahead of you"" and i told him that it was okay i'll wait. So i'm waiting and so I waited, and when the 2 people that were ahead of me were attened/helped. He took in another elderly customer that came in while I was waiting, I understand that he's elderly and he too needs a haircut. But if he was a walk-in then it should be first come, first serve. But no, I got skipped and there I go waiting again. He said that the guy next to him was going to take care of my haircut, but honestly at this point i'm impatient. Tired of waiting and after he finished the elderly man's haircut. He walked off and left, and at that point I was convinced that this ""business owner"" clearly is not about business and does not care about customer satisfaction or returning customers. I walked off and left, never ever going to back this bad place. Damian's Barber Shop next to him has better reviews than him. I'll probably give that place a try they're probably better. But seriously if you can avoid this place, please do!"
"Horrible , horrible , I called to make an appointment on Saturday for Monday .

"I went online to apply at River City Staffing.  The website wanted candidates to upload their resume.  I called River City Staffing to find out if they were looking for a resume that they would use to screen me, or if they were looking for a resume that could be forwarded to employers.  The recruiter told me they were looking for a resume that contained my work history.  I got the recruiter's name and email address.

I sent her a cover letter explaining that I'd been out of the corporate world for a number of years and I attached a paragraph style resume that highlighted my office skills, had my most pertinent info on the first page and my work history on the second page.

The recruiter replied via email that she hadn't read my resume because it was ""unclear"" and she was ""confused"" by the paragraph style.  She told me we could discuss employment opportunities only after I rewrote my resume to conform to a bullet style template which she sent as an attachment.

I called the recruiter because I wasn't sure how to make my resume conform to the template.  The recruiter was very condescending when she explained that a resume ""must"" be bulleted and in chronological order.  I responded that my most pertinent work experience was not my most recent employment, and that I'd written my resume in a way that emphasized my most pertinent experience, but I did include my work history so she had a sense of the kinds of work I've done.   The recruiter insisted that I use her template.  I said I didn't think we'd be a good fit.

In the mean time, I landed a job with another agency using the resume rejected by River City Staffing.  When I asked the other recruiter if he would like me to revise my resume, he said my resume was fine.  (This conversation occurred before the exchange with RCS.)"

"My daughter said it was a great place so we looked online and it said open till 10 PM, we drove all the way there, only to find THEY CLOSED AT 9, 8 minutes before.  The guy was cleaning and said ""were closed, too bad"".

If they close at 9, make it 9 on the web. If people drive there based on the POSTED hours, accommodate them.

Now my cousin who lives there currently is being harassed by the ladies at the front office that she always owes extra on their rent when their lease hasnt even been renewed. I'd stay away from this place, they seem to want to push out their veteran tenants and soon enough won't have any tenants left."
These apartments suck there all types of homeless people that do alot of drugs my got broken into 5 times in the past year from all the crack head the office only knows how to say it's not of there control and they will not doing nothing about it im so happy I moved out last month it waa worth for me to break my less 3 months early I wish I read the reviews before i got this apartment because they want mkre then any other apartments out there but there about the worst I ever seen its a very rough place to live at I use to be embarrassed to have friends and family to come over cuss theres always homeless people fighting and where my parking stall was at there was a car who dose body work on cars and over spray from always painting cars use to go all over my car so they let there tenants do what they want I notice they td me no one can have more then one car if you dont own a garage which is never available and everyone haves thers own parking but they have to many cars from all the homeless people that dont even run and uncountable times random people use to park In my parking stall and they even towed my car cuss someone parked in my stall and I parked in a uncovered stall which office says its on to park there but they towed my car cuss some crack head parked in my stall so worst apartments ever and the pool area alwaya have weird people smoking weed around it I went to the pool once and I waa so gross out from it I didnt even go in thw pool
"If only there was an option of zero stars, becuase this place Stonegate is deserving of it. The owner responded to a diffrent review saying, ""some things are out of our control"" pertaining to Vehicles being broken into. My car was broken into the third day I moved in and just so happens it's not underneath the camera, so the renter's insurance policy won't cover it. There's two cameras over the jacuzzi at Stonegate watching every person that gets in and out of that jacuzzi. If those two cameras were over the parking lots perhaps it be a safer place perhaps you would be able to control the criminal activity and make it a safer place.

There are bugs everywhere in this place, so infested and you know why because they have Dewey Pest Control. This is the worst and cheapest Pest Control you can possibly have.

I was leased an apartment, but prior I was given a visual floor plan that has more square footage than the actual unit I got. There was no frigerator the dishwasher was broken the stove top exhaust doesn't work.

The first thing I did was put in a work order for the broken step leading up to my apartment to be fixed and they never did it. Maintenance told me that they needed to get a hold of corporate to be approved to spend that sort of money. The safety of the residents and their belongings are not of any concern to the owner of this place. Months now have passed and a few weeks back I was told corporate cleared a check to fix the stair, but it's still broken 5 months down the road.

It's clear to me that the staff of this complex have their hands tied and they really do try and acomidate all 160 residents request. Jeffrey Miller and the shareholders of Pacific Living Places are raking in profits and not providing the maintenece or office workers with the tools required to operate a safe livable place for people.

The security cameras are operated by one IT dude whom is contracted not to share any video footage with residence. I found this out becuase this time my work truck was broken into and it was right in the cameras line of sight. He, nor the staff here was willing to show me the footage, so I could share it with police in hopes of getting my tools back. Sadly the esurance renters insurance required for each resident to have in order to stay here won't even pay out the policy with the theft happening on camera. Miller insurance a provider of rental insurance started by family of CEO of PLP Jeff Miller are incauhuts bambosaling tenats for as much money as they can stuff in their hollow hearts.

The security working on Friday thrue Sunday night rides a motercycle around the complex with no helmet or company identification on himself, setting of car alarms. The security number provided by the complex is a scam. They don't dispatch anyone in the time of need or crime reported. I called many times and their soul purpose is to alert the office that a report was made to them. Then I reported to the office and they to,d me to report to the number that actually just reports back to the office.

The insurance company has not responded to my email in a week about my work truck being broken into. I will add to this review as the time passes and I find out more.

August 18th of 2018 its been several months scince I have vacated the facility. I paid out all the closing cost and wished everything to be done in the earlier days of June 2018. I have talked with Mary(white) Vanessa(Latina) Robin(African-American) almost on a wekley basis trying to get my security deposit back.
