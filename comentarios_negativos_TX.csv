"I gave them 2 stars because they offer prescriptions at a lower cost, and when I didn't have insurance, that was invaluable. The pharmacist is rude and arrogant, though. He's probably the worst I've ever encountered. I'll never go back."
"If I could put minus stars I would. This has to be the worst pharmacy in all of North Texas. My doctor put in my prescription on Monday. I had my son go pick it up and they told to come back on Tuesday. I went on Tuesday to pick it up and they told me it still not ready. For some odd reason they did not like the Doctors instructions and refused to fill the prescription until the here back from the doctor. Each Time we waited over 30 minutes just for them to say "" It's not ready."" Now here it is Wednesday and I decided to call instead of waiting in line again. They said ""Oh ya we talked to the doctor."" I said OK I will pickup now. OH wait its still NOT READY."
Please fix your restroom doors
This pharmacy Walmart dose not work not come again

"I called this store yesterday (Sunday)at 3:46 in the afternoon. This is the store that I purchased the cell phone from the day before Christmas...so this was the store I called when I had a question about the phone malfunctioning. The young man that answered the phone didn't even attempt to be helpful. I told him the phone was Auto resetting to factory on its own and that it's done it three times dumping everything in the phone. I asked what I needed to do to get a warranty exchange because the phone is only 3 months old. He asked if I had cricket insurance on it I said no the phone is 3 months old and under warranty. He then said oh we don't do that you need to call Samsung. I said since when does a customer have to call Samsung, the phone manufacturer, for a warranty exchange? He said we just don't do that you have to contact Samsung. I again questioned why the store wasn't giving directions for warranty exchanges his reply was ""WE'RE A FRANCHISE"". So my take away from that is that they'll sell you a phone but that's where the customer service stops. After getting off the phone with this store, I called The Colony location and the man at that location was so helpful (even though I didn't buy the phone there)... he said that all I needed to do was dial 611 from a different phone on my family plan so that I had the phone that was malfunctioning available to read the numbers under the battery to them and that they would arrange for my warranty exchange. It took the gentleman at the Colony location less time to give me those simple instructions (less than 1 minute from start to finish) than it took the young man at the Little Elm location to keep refusing to give me the same information, give me incorrect information and make excuses. I was on the phone with Cricket (not samsung) for maybe 5 minutes.  I have a claim number and everything set up to ship it back to them and a new phone arrives within two days. Now, how come the Colony location can help a customer with basic directions on what to do, yet the Little Elm location says they're a franchise/not their problem? In the future I think I'll simply buy my next 4 new phones at the Colony location (since all the phones are the same) so that I feel like the customer service stays with me the whole entire time I'm a customer...not just while I have my wallet open. Little Elm Cricket...that's how you earn customer/brand loyalty...or in your case lose it. Owner...save the form reply you will attach to this review and use that few minutes training your employees on proper phone etiquette and directions on how a customer can initiate a warranty return through cricket... it would be time well spent. You never get a second chance to keep a customer"

Failing to see what the big deal is. 6 sliders + rings + mozz sticks = $28??  The tastiest item was the mozzticks. The rings weren't anything special and if not for the pickle slice and bbq sauce the sliders would have zero flavor; the meat itself doesn't have a flavor at all. Work on it guys.
Horrible experience. They did not inform me about the lab results (which was positive) for a month. I suffered for a month unnecessarily. The doctor passed the blame to the nurses the nurses passed it to the lab!
I don't recommend this place to nobody. They take to long and they don't really care for their people under there care. They are mostly after the $$$... I had the worst experiance with them when I was in labor with my child. And after that too...
Be prepared to wait 4 hours for your yearly exam.

These people have failed in finding a decent job for my sister. She's had countless appointments. Some of which had been cancelled the moment she arrived.

"Dont trust these thugs. They take paying customers cars on joy rides. Just google ""Royal Towing joyride"""
"Saw the video of your ""emplyees"" joy riding in a paying customers car. Wow you guys are a bunch of idiots! Your driver could have killed someome going that fast in a neighborhood! I'm glad that man is pressing chargers on your driver and hopefully he sues the crap out of you too. I hope this dump gets shut down."
""" A Texas tow truck company Royal Towing LLC is in trouble after one of their contract drivers was caught taking a client's car for a joyride by that car's dashcam.""

"" ABC13 contacted Royal Towing LLC, the company in question, and was told that the driver in the video is not an employee, but rather a contractor. Therefore, they claim, the incident is not the company's responsibility. When asked whose responsibility it was, Royal Towing refused to answer. ""

That's how this company responds to one of their ""contractors"" STEALING a customer's car.

Would you trust YOUR vehicle with this company? ""Whoops, sorry there Mr. / Ms. customer, we don't know that guy, therefore TOO BAD NOT OUR FAULT, SEE YA!""

So this company hires contractors, but they are not responsible for who they hire hmm?

Stay far... FAR away from this company. I sincerely hope the owner reads this as they go out of business. You should not be a business owner if you can't handle or take responsibility for who your company hires."
Despicable trash company. Hire bad workers and allowed them to take other peoples 100k car out for a joyride. I hope you get sue and lose everything. Fire the manager since they aren't doing anything about it.  I'll mess them up if it was my car.
"Next time don't hire sleezy drivers to accentuate your sleezy ""business""."

I try to change my contract because of these i send the old lady to talk to them they change it with out sgin a paperwork because we been living here for 5 years and We supposed trust them so they said   we take care of it and they charge me for monthly payment which is higher then 6 months contract after that month they said o we sorry we didn't change the contract so u have to stack with us until September i told them i can't because i have to move the ‏Apartment its not good for human living  every day i have this problem and i have to leave they said pay for all the months left i asked alot of Neighbors they same problem so have fun with this
The staff is great. Maintainance is always on time. Lived here for about 4 years. Initially when I moved in the place was great but later on the place started going downhill. Woke up one morning about to go to work only to find out someone had stolen one of my tires. Another time someone broke into my car. It's roach infested.
Don't do it
The Worst place ive ever purchased a car from i was told my car payment was 430.00 a month but in reality it was 960.00 a month for a 2018 Mercedes c300...I wasn't informed on that! i would never buy a car for that much EVER minding you I put down 4700 down on the car! After dropping 4700 on the car two weeks later i paid another 967.95  and two weeks later after that another 597.95 they did not communicate with me what's so ever On top of that the sales man sincere is a creep he was to busy trying to flirt with me very unprofessional.....

"when I got my care I had just moved here to Houston. when I first got the care it was infested with roaches, they infused it that didn't work, then after that the airbag light is still on I got this car in may 23 2016 I asked them to trade me out of the car they never did they was talking about more money down. I'm like no cause they knew this care was infested with roaches. I don't do roaches. I never dealt with a company who don't like to compensate the customers. now the problem I have is every time I buy brand new tires for the car they are always going on flat. I think its something that has to do with tire rods. they always hanging up the phone on me just so they want have to deal with me. so I've decided to take them court on a lemon law charge. this car is lemon. they not trying to fix anything now I'm also having transmission problems. I will never deal with these people again. they are worst and horrible people to deal with."
Tell me I am guaranteed a vehichle just bring documents and the down payment I stated in my application which I called to verify 2 times before I drove an hour. Then the sales guy tells me he cant do nothing for me without 5000 bucks and never looked up his phone once to tell me.
I went on 10/24/2020 at 2:45pm and waiting 30 minutes for help. No one came to help or ask to see if I needed help. They all were to busy BBQ in back

When I asked about the lowering the price of an old 360 game which case was crushed, that was priced $20 (new price) she caught an attitude and threw the game behind the counter and snorted no.

"Take it from someone who has been consistently doing business with them for years, they are not terrible but they are far from a 5 star company. Very inconsistent customer service,  they tell you one thing and do another. I do not recommend."
"I really dislike this location. Wells Fargo as a whole is fairly decent even though I would never bank with them. This location is ridiculous to say the least! It's like it's on another planet. The service is severely sub par, the service associates are short and rude and not at all helpful. They are dressed the part of professionals but thats were their professionalism ends. I occasionally need to cash checks here, this location is the closest to me but I honestly will drive out of my way to avoid this disgrace of a bank!"
"The customer service is great!  But if you're wanting to get in and get out, this isn't the spot for you.  Be prepared to wait in a long line and spend 15-30 minutes waiting on a teller.  7 spots open, only 3-4 tellers utilized.  If you're wanting to sit down and talk to someone, be prepared to wait even longer!  Last time I waited an hour just to see a notary that took only 5 minutes.  Great bank, great service, terrible planning for large crowds.  A bank in little Mexico needs to be fully staffed!  Just a suggestion."
The worst bank ever loves to nickle and dime everyone and when you go to close your account then they want to try to keep you bye bye wellsfargo hello Velocity......
What ever you do dont give them your debit card info! They charged me twice then after calling a dozen times and finally admitting it they offer writing a check which forced me to drive across town. On another note they do not report to the the credit agencies regularly so you pay on a high interest loan with no boost to your credit. I highly recommend going to another company!
"I would give zero stars if I could!!!! Don’t go here. They will tell you one thing and even give you paperwork and do completely the opposite!!!!! They have withdrawn double payments from my account  consecutive weeks. No warnings, nothing, they just take twice as much on dates you don’t agree on. When you call to tell them they say they are reversing it but they don’t. They have done it to me on multiple occasions!!!! Stay away from this place. There are other options and I can’t wait to just be done with them!!!!!"

"Terrible experience! Dont go with this company. Loan Docs not processed right away. List could go on and on with mistakes made. Most importantly, Purchasing a home is already a stressful process. Going with this company will add to that stress every single day before closing. If you ever get there. Go with someone else!"
"Months after closing I noticed they recorded my mortgage and reported to my insurance that I purchased the home three days before I closed. Even the county thinks the day I purchased the home is wrong. Also typed my phone number in wrong! When they sold my loan it transferred incorrectly. Sloppy, careless work. Cost me money! Paid for three days of insurance I didn’t use. If I hadn’t closed I wonder if they’d be in trouble. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
If I could right a lower review i would. They are miss leading will lie to you tie up your money. Care nothing for your family. I regret ever putting my family through the situation with DHI. I have spent more money now just from there lack of know how to do a job. If you are wise stay away from them no matter how much they say they will save you in closing cost. It will cost you more to deal with there incompetence. Do a loan with a loan shark at least you know what you are getting.
"My family had to stay in a hotel for a WEEK because this title company didn't want to do their job. They are unorganized, unprofessional, and rude! BEWARE! THEY DO NOTHING ON TIME! We were supposed to close on the 14th and had to wait over 2 weeks to get our keys. After we closed on our house and all the paperwork was SIGNED AND DONE. We were still refused our keys because they needed MORE DOCUMENTS!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS TITLE COMPANY."
"They were awful and they completely screwed us in 2016. They not only sold our loan to Pennymac they did not take into account appropriate escrows and we just had to refi and get away from Pennymac costing almost 10k in closing costs. Shame on you!!! DR Horton, DHI its corrupt. Stay away!!! Don't use them to close it sounds easy to do everything through them but heed my warning they are awful. And will never recommend buying one of their homes. The money we spent fixing and upgrading is unbelievable. The CEO down is corrupt. Stay away!!!"

"It's a disappointment that I had a bad experience without actually seeing Dr De La Rosa. I recently transfered to de la rosa because I didn't feel comfortable with my first choice in a Dr. unfortunately the office calls me one day before my appointment to tell me de la rosa is refusing to see me because he doesn't accept ""transfers"". Even though he was my Dr in 2007..??? Even did a surgery on me. Waited a month for that appointment for them to tell me he won't be seeing me and they have no other doctor available. So I made a appointment with a different facility which  it's going to take another month.  I am high risk already. Thank you for making my pregnancy more difficult than what it is. do research before making a appointment. Because apparently they decide if you'll be thier patient or not."
Always be sure you get a paper copy of your prescription the day of your appointment if your prescriptions are submitted through an electronic system. These people have no sense of urgency

"Within90 days of my child being there she caught 3 major germs. It was the pinkeye in both eyes, ringworm in her head and lastly the hand, foot & mouth disease. I expected her to get the common cold, runny nose, common things but what she caught were things that shown the daycare is unclean and not kept up as it should be. One of the employees called after 2 weeks of my daughter not being ther and said yeah we had another child with the hand, foot & mouth disease. I believe the proper thing to do would've been to contact the parents with a letter informing them of the incident and assurance that the place would be cleaned to decrease the risk of spreading. She didn't learn anything there beside cartoon characters (Dora & Diego)."
"(Translated by Google) My daughter was here for a year, we were really happy, but last week she had an accident which NO ONE TOLD ME ANYTHING !!!
She brought her broken lip and her clothes with blood, I sent a message to Ms. Kerry to ask for an explanation and she only told me that she did not know anything but that she would investigate it. And it turned out that it was not blood what was on the clothes if it was not FOOD! As if I did not know the difference between food and blood !!! And my daughter's broken lip?

"I have not had any children enrolled here nor would I ever!! Today, 8/8/18, the male driver of ""bus 1"" on highway 287 almost hit me when he tried to change lanes on 287 north without checking his mirror or blind spot. I almost ate the barrier. Laying on my horn did not seem to phase him. Guess I will report this to the state as well. I honestly could not tell if children were on the bus but I am guessing it was a field trip or something as there were two of their buses. HORRIBLE"
"In all of the years my of using child care centers/daycares this one is by far the worst one. The director Ms. Margret is very incompetent in her role. With every single in counter my family had with her the only response she had was "" I have never experienced that before"". I'm not sure if this started from the moment I informed her my children stated the bus driver who was her son was using curse words and saying the N word while driving bus felt uncomfortable by this that she was unable to effectively do her job or what. I'm assuming the turn around rate at this facility is high as well because there were several different teachers in this room in the short time my children attended. My 6yr old everyday would beg me not to let her come to daycare because we made a big mistake are her words.  However my biggest issue is that the she hires people who I guess do not understand how to do their job effectively. The ""teacher"" (use this term loosely) did not do her job. She failed to communicate with me as the parent of the children. She never spoke or addressed me about anything. Per Margret she felt ""uncomfortable "", but if that were the case she should not be a ""teacher"". Which is also a common thing throughout the entire facility.  If they do not know you, you will not be greeted.Margaret complained about small issues that she should have been able to handle and nothing was ever her fault or within her job of handling. Our last straw was her treating my child (9) as a criminal over a toy that shouldn't have been brought to the daycare in the first place nor did he steal. I was not notified of any issues at pickup. My husband and I were notified of the issue at the end of business the next day right before pick up.Margaret is also a liar. If you would like to take your children here, beware if your kids are not raised by ""them"" they will be mistreated. Also if your children are telling you that any child care center was a mistake, they hate it, feel uncomfortable listen to them!

Edit: My family has never had any problems at any other daycares or the elementary school. Seems to me you all are the problem. Saying a child has ""behavior problems "" because you can't control them? All of the other child centers had no problems except you. Let's also not forget you all sent a few of your ""parents"" to leave comments under my review on Facebook. What business uses their customers to bully others? While we are on that topic let's talk about how you do not accept families that have a different religious beliefs other than your own."
