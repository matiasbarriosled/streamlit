"Basing my review strictly on the service I received from Sergio.

Very knowledgeable, patient and understanding. I didn‚Äôt feel rushed or pushed to make a decision on what phone/plan I wanted. He waited till I made the decision that was right for ME and that makes a huge positive difference when dealing with a sales person.

HIGHLY recommend seeing Sergio at this store!"

"Best massage I've ever had. My massage guy was Oleg, he was excellent, and I'm picky with massages. Also tried the 24k gold facial which was ok, guess will see in the next few days if it did anything. My facial lady gave a couple of good pointers. Definitely will return! Also the lady at the front desk was super nice!!"

Love this place.  We bring Dash our service dog there.  They took him when he was a pup (completely vaccinated and verified it with papers).  They were and are always patient treating him with care and love.  We always pick up Dash satisfied with whatever service we request that day.

Postive experience. With my friday appointment. After my exam the gentlemen helped me pick out a great pair of glasses the back office staff was great. The doctor was very kind.
"It was my first time entering that store and I'm very pleased to say that the employees are very nice. They go ahead and behind, I'm excited to get my new pair of glasses."
Very friendly staff and a great selection of eyeware frames.
The staff at Buffalo Bearings is second to none!! They are so helpful and friendly.  They go the extra mile to find what you need!!
"Every time I need to find a bearing for a go-kart, mini bike, dirt bike, atv, yard equipment, trailer, mower blades, utility tires, tubes, sprockets, throttle cables, clutchs and much more for your equipment or weekend toys. Give them a call. Greg Sr. is a plethora of information and knowledge. All but one time they‚Äôve had the part/parts that I needed in-stock in there warehouse. The one and only time they didn‚Äôt they had the part within a weeks time. Customer service is out standing. I am a return customer and will continue to do future business. And I would like to thank Greg Sr. for making those tough projects easier. Support your local business."
Terrific customer service. They usually have what I need and the older gentleman had an encyclopedic knowledge of bearings.
"Needed a bushing, they found it right away. Great service"
"Top notch service, expertise, very friendly, always have what I need in stock."
Excellent people!

The donuts is always a good place to buy something quickly
I went into this Dunkin' yesterday and got something because I was starving. I was talking to this person who was in front of me on line. I had mentioned to him that it was my birthday. The girl behind the counter then offered me a free drink!  I was NOT expecting that! They have the nicest people and you will not be let down if you go here!! I ended up getting the Iced green tea matcha latte! It was so good and refreshing! You guys made my day. Thank you again!! :)
"Friendly staffs, nice donuts and muffins and coffee. It opens at 6am, it‚Äôs good to stop by to get a coffee (and donuts) before catching the train."

"I came by yesterday to pick up some pizza on the way home and the food was amazing.  Best crust around - easily.  I ordered a calzone, one chocolate slice (amazing), two cheese slices and a potato slice (all for my wife and me and lunch for her next day).  Everything was perfect.  The guy behind the counter seemed nice (I think he may have been the owner) and price-wise may have been a bit pricey, but then again, the pizza really is that much better and then again, pizza prices around the city are about the same.  I'll definitely go back."
"Love their pizza and their service!
REALLY ITALIANO!"
Used to get lunch here nearly every day. You will be missed.
Quick and helpful response at any time

Very pleasant experience. The delivery was on time but the recipient wasn‚Äôt there. The florist left a message and returned the next day with the bouquet. Nice people.
Great selection even better service!
"The bouquet was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! She loved it. TYVM, Josette, for your help!"
"I love this place, especially because of the lovely woman I assume is the owner. They have great gifts, plants, decorative  products and flowers. Everyone has been so friendly and helpful and talented and patient, and the prices are great. I just love coming in here. I usually just wander in only having a vague idea of what I'm looking for, give them an even more vague description or amount I want to spend, and I always quickly end up with the most wonderful bunch of affordable, beautifully presented  flowers to share with my friend (who is always just as happy with them).
I think they even hold some classes, and although I've not yet been able to attend any, I hope they hold more because I am eager to learn, just because I enjoy the store so much. Thank you!"
They have taken care to provide lovely flowers for our annual ONYA Bud To Bloom Luncheon in 2018 and 2019.  Excellent service and attention to detail.
Always excellent. Go often for flowers.

They helped my career skyrocket in a short time. I am now a New York Certified Broker. Thank you for allowing me in your good graces.
"It was a fortune to meet Cristina, she explained that her job is more service than sales. She has thorough knowledge of home construction and the local market. When we viewed an apartment Cristina would give comments on the quality of construction, finish, appliances, etc. She also led me through multiple rounds of negotiation to get to a price i was comfortable with. In the end I found the place that was perfect for me."
I had a great experience of working with Kenneth Beak. Thanks to him I found a perfect place in Astoria and he was very helpful during the application process as well. Highly recommend him if you're looking to make your NY apartment hunting process easier.
Best real estate in NYC if any one need consultancy or  help in finding the best place to live then contact with them. one of my friend recommend me when i was looking for an apartment i really appreciate their work. They help both landlords & tenants. I highly recommend all of you who are looking for place in NYC.
I worked with Kenneth Beak and he helped me find apartment quickly. He was very responsive and provided good suggestions and recommendations.
"I worked with Jack Malykin and Living New York and I could not be happier. He was super responsive and helpful, which is so rare for NYC, and I ended up with the best apartment. Thank you again!!"
"A friend of mine had the pleasure of working with Melanie Nazarian, and he has found her to be very experienced and helpful in assisting him with finding to buy a property in Manhattan."
Matt did an amazing job finding me and my team many re- location options. He is very pro-active and knowledgeable! Definitely reccomend him and will use him in the future.
A consummate professional. THANK YOU.
Matt is very informative Person regarding Real Estate services.
Any want to have real estate consultancy should straight come to them because its my personal experience I wanted an apartment in city but was very upset due to bad consultancy then my friend tell me about them so I was very satisfied with their services.

"Great gelato in a small corner of the West Village. Go here for real ice cream. They seem to only have traditional flavors, but they know how to make them well. Went with a friend, got two cups, planned to eat it while walking at Washington Square Park, only two blocks away, but the ice cream was so good we finished it on the way."
"This gelataria is very similar to what you will find in Italy.   The first sign that it is a good place is that the pistachio is not green.   They will let you taste, and there is a good variety of flavors.   The owner was very friendly, and shared our craving for Malaga flavor (rum/raisin).   Apparently it doesn't sell that well, but if it is as good as the flavors we tasted, try it."
"Yum. I spent a summer living a half block from this place and it never got old. Beats the places around it. Love the straciatella, pistachio, coffee... forest fruits, yogurt... The list goes on, really."
The peach gelato is amazing. It is the perfect treat on a hot day.

As far as I can tell I don't think I'll need anything else BUT if I do I'm call Guardian.

And the staff is pleasant to speak with. No attitudes."
Tony and his team are very professional and offer quality work thanks again for all the custom work

Nice neighborhood shop. I showed the barber a picture of what I wanted and he flawlessly duplicated it. Eddie was friendly and asked enough questions to make certain that the cut was exactly what I wanted. Pricing was low with quality sky high.
I‚Äôve been going to this Barber Shop since 1999. Frank Eddie and Tony are very personable guys.
Eddie best barber hands down
Nice
"I've been going here since I was in middle school. Good prices, good people."

"If you're looking for a broker in Jackson Heights, Jeff's going to be your best bet. He was a pleasure to work with. He understood the process inside-out and he's someone I look forward to working with again in the future should the need arise. Really, nothing but positive things to say about him as a person and as a professional."
"Jeff was great to work with. He's patient, knowledgeable, and straight forward.  My husband and I were first time buyers and he helped us each step of the way, willing to answer any questions and give trustworthy advice. He made a grueling process bearable and even fun at times. He's definitely someone enjoyable and reliable to help you find a home."
"When it comes to Jackson Heights, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone more knowledgeable or passionate than Jeff. We had a very specific list of needs and we were willing to wait until the right house came along. Jeff was with us every step of the way, and when the right house came on the   market, he made sure we got it.
Jeff is honest and direct, two qualities that can be rare in his industry. He is also a joy to work with. We are very happy with our new home, and just as happy to now have Jeff as a neighbor."
"Jeff and Michelle of Beaudoin Realty provided a great home buying experience for us. There was a lot that we didn't know given that this is the first home that we'd purchased. Jeff was always there with the answers when we needed them. Jeff was super helpful throughout the home search, the inspection, the final walkthrough, and the closing meeting. Michelle was great at helping us through the bidding process. Would recommend them both highly!"

"*This is a review of the Liberty Diner, not the theater itself*

My favorite place to grab a bite to eat when I'm around Times Square. They have an all American menu serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. From omelets, all the way to steak. Prices are reasonable compared to surrounding restaurants in the area, All day and night Happy Hour for their famous  $5 margaritas as well as draft beers. The service was extremely friendly, they made sure I was well taken care of.

Times Square can get pretty hectic and the Liberty Diner's laid-back environment creates a nice atmosphere to step away from the noise as you enjoy your meal."
"Super nice speakeasy theatre
We saw dollhouse:
AMAZING, we had a great night between songs and dances, with fantastic artist who recreated the Ziegfeld story. we loved walking around the theatre, going from the main stage to the bar/Paris and the glass windows room/Ritz hotel."
Been here for a few events.  Space is very attractive. Staff was great also.
"All the parties here are great, the sound is awesome, but the drinks are pretty pricey"
This is a basic gym that pretty much has all of the equipment that you need.  I have visited here often and it's always pretty quiet and relaxing.  This location is kept very clean.  Very nice locker room with showers.  They also have a juice bar upstairs and offer towel service.
"With over 30 years as a writer in the health and fitness industry under my belt I have trained in gyms in both the USA and UK in my time.
I went to this one with my friend two weeks ago when we were on a time crunch.
The staff were very friendly (from earlier reviews I believe the previous owners were not so friendly) and the equipment was pretty decent given the square footage. The one thing I would criticize is the placement of the benches too close to the weight racks and mirror and screwed down so you cannot move them back for more comfort and space to handle the weights.
The locker rooms were clean...oh and I have to mention the fact it was nice to see a Nautilus machine. I haven't seen one of those for what must be over 30 years when I lived near a Nautilus gym in Aberdeen, Scotland.
So...if you are reading over past reviews please rest assured that this is under new management and safe lol.
Worth checking out if you find yourself down town."
"Great hidden gem, good amount of equipment and friendly front desk staff.
You can use Popin here for a quick lunch workout if you dont like committing right away. No more excuses not to get that summer body:)"
"A very good gym, and not part of a chain! There is a real owner, who is always there, and takes a personal interest in the running of the gym. I love supporting a small business,  and enjoying an excellent gym!"
"Great location if u live in Tribeca,not too full so you have ur privacy. Juice bar is awesome. A lot of equipment and locker room is amazing. Front desk is always super polite. and they have Amazing personal trainers. If ur in the area,Ask for Chantha Thach,she will help you outüòâüëçüèªüôåüèª"

"This shop has lovely gifts that are lovely, quirky, colorful, and charming. I love browsing this place and testing my willpower (because if I don't, I will spend all my money here). The items can be a bit pricey but sometimes it's fun to splurge on something. I recommend stopping by when you need to get that gift for your weird friend."
"This is one of my favorite stores.  They have a bunch of cute and quirky items.  The store itself is very bright and colorful which screams ""FUN""!! Once you're inside you're totally distracted by all of the cool items that they have."
"If you've never been here, you'll really enjoy this place.  It's full of inexpensive trinkets ranging funky designer fun to just plain colorful crap, but you'll enjoy the vast selection and the wit that's evident in just about everything.  If there's a female under 16 on your gift list, head straight here.  If you're just interested in international manufacturing and marketing trends, this place is a don't miss."
"Super cute, quirky, unique gifts. They have a range of useful things from shovels to nail clippers, pens, tables, dishes...a huge variety.

Colorful things, funny, great design.

Not for boring people!"
Looking for a quirky gift for someone who doesn't need anything and don't want to spend a ton of money? This is a great place. Some of the things I've seen here I haven't seen anywhere else. Guaranteed to get you out of a bind!
"The place was a very nice decoration and space, the service is super friendly and fast. The coffee is really good. It was great to have all the options in the menu with no meat. The Benedict breakfast is good, but i saw the potato fries in the next table and i was jealous. the scramble tofu with vegetables is great"
I'm not vegan but I did stop by here when I was eating clean.  I had the Eggplant Lasagne and it was delicious!! Very tasty.  They also have a full vegan wine bar which was definitely a plus.  This is a very intimate restaurant.  My waiter was great.  I would definitely return.
"V-Note had been on my vegan must-try list for a while. We finally made it there for brunch a couple of months ago. The menu is extremely enticing, but all I can remember about the food is that I thought it was average. Good, but not life-changing. Mainly just not too memorable. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would probably be a regular here, but feel less motivated to make a cross-town trip for a return visit."
I love V-Note for its varied menu and large portions. Love the pasta entree and the salads are also terrific. Staff is here to be of service and the decor is charmingly informal but comfortable.
"We tried this place out because of a Groupon we saw. To be honest, it was actually a fantastic time. I was going in with an open mind and I wasn't disappointed. The drink were even great. We choose this place because we have a friend that must eat gluten free and this place definitely delivered in both a wide variety and in taste. The atmosphere for me seemed a bit dark, but for others, they may find this to be a good intimate or romantic scene for a date. Overall, our waitress, food, drinks and the price were just right. No matter the mix of individual personalities in your party, someone is bound to find something they will enjoy."
"V-Note is my restaurant of choice for my birthday celebration dinner.  My companion is not vegetarian nor vegan but was greatly surprised at the flavor and textures of the meal.  I love the atmosphere and especially love the food and the fact that I don't need to scramble about the menu the find something I will or can eat.

The perfect place to get your car/truck batteries price are extremely low great deals.
"Service was so fast! As soon as I walked in he knew which battery I needed , he told another employee to get my battery while he was helping another customer and he even came outside and installed the new battery for me. One of the employees was able to speak Spanish which was a big help for my mom. They had so many other batteries besides interstate big selection"
Super friendly service and they charged and tested my battery. Would recommend coming here first they know what they are doing!

Delicious maple syrup!
Went to the farm during Maple Weekend. Informative visit to the Sugar House. Bought some products from the store. Delicious! Would return!
Super homey farm feel. Staff is great. This year when we got our tree they had some vendors with homemade baked goods in the shop as well as their own delicious Maple syrup.
Unfortunately it was closed when I stopped by on Sunday. It is scenic drive getting there.
Great vegetables and great sense of community.

"I was a latecomer, visiting the orthodontist to explore straightening my teeth at age 56. I was blown away from my first visit. From the state of the art equipment, the ambience of the office, the warm and friendly staff,  their training and professionalism is outstanding. Dr. Barr treated me  like family and I loved going for my visits and I  LOVED The RESULTS. I can't stop smiling. Highly Recommended."
"My family has been coming here for years and has received nothing less than ""exceptional service and above excellent"" results. I highly recommend Brigham Barr Orthodontics."
"Years after being treated at BBO, my daughter Marilyn‚Äôs smile was spectacular at her wedding. Thank you for long lasting work & a great staff."
Very polite and professional. They go out of their way to make the patients and their families feel welcome.
"Both of my kids have been patients for many years. They have received top-notch care from Drs Bridgham & Barr and their dedicated staff.  The office runs like an efficient machine. Wait times are normally less than 5 minutes, but that doesn't matter as the kids are highly entertained by the ammenities in the well appointed waiting area.   My kids have beautiful smiles!"
"Although I rarely write reviews, I've been meaning to write this review for over a year!  Hope it helps folks in the Northern Westchester/Putnam County areas (and beyond) to decide on orthodontic treatment...

My journey with orthodontic treatment started over 4 years ago when I asked my daughter's orthodontist, Dr. Gardner, to look at my teeth. I was in my mid-50s at the time. Several of my lower front teeth were worn half-way down. No related pain, just unsightly. He immediately knew what was up and explained things would only get worse. My jaw and bite were misaligned.  I scheduled an evaluation and he subsequently provided me with several treatment options.  Before I finally decided on treatment (the potential pain to my mouth and wallet took some time to process), Dr. Gardner informed me he was retiring.

He told me he had looked long and hard to sell his practice to ""the best and most ethical area orthodontist"" he could find. He sold it to Dr. Bridgham. I trusted his decision and set up an evaluation with Dr. Bridgham. Best health decision I ever made. Dr. Bridgham, using 3-D imaging (vs. Dr. Gardner's older 2-D imaging panoramic x-ray), was able to eliminate the treatment option that involved removing some of my teeth! I still needed metal braces to get the job done, but it would take less time (and NO tooth extraction)!  I obtained two other orthodontist evaluations and only felt comfortable with Dr. Bridgham.

Around 15 months later, my teeth were as straight and aligned as they were when my first braces came off when I was 9 years old (yes, I had braces as a child)!  [Note to self, and others - wear your retainers for life!!]
Dr. Bridgham (and Dr. Barr) always took the time to explain what they were doing, what the result would be, and what I should expect along the way. I never waited more than a few minutes upon arrival for any type of appointment. Their staff was extremely professional (they took and retained the best from Dr. Gardner's office to blend in with their existing staff), reflecting their own degree of professionalism. I was more than satisfied with the whole experience (which is saying a lot when I'm paying dearly for a service!).  Good orthodontics isn't cheap, but given my condition I had no choice if I wanted to live and chew into old age...

So, what made me finally write this review?
As I go to more and more doctors (I care for my 93 year old dad, too), I realize Dr. Bridgham and Dr. Barr are at the top of their profession - they are the complete package. Great communicators, ethical, knowledgeable in their field, compassionate, and respectful. They are the standard I now use to evaluate other health care professionals... and, unfortunately, some just don't measure up..."
"The attention I got was great and very quick.
I was treated with respect and professionalism.
Even though I got bad news I felt supported and received heartfelt treatment"
"Dr. Tsai clearly explains everything the patient needs to know and is a wonderful advocate for his patients. He is very direct, which is how I like my doctors. His office is staffed with kind nurses and receptionists who are always available to respond to your questions. Dr. Johnson, the anesthesiologist, is very professional and cordial, offering a much needed sense of calm just prior to having a procedure done. I am very happy to recommend Dr. Tsai if you ever need any Gyn procedures performed."

"Absolutely LOVE this place üòÄ Allen and Kathy are super helpful and dedicated to ensuring you safely enjoy your artistic experience from beginning to end.  Safety protocols are excellent with masks, temp check, sign-in and socially distant paint stations.   Pick your piece, choose your color palette, then create!  They will keep your finished piece to glaze and fire it, then you will return to pick up the finished masterpiece in 14 days.  This great small business is a treasure!  Call for reservations to save your seat and get ready to enjoy two hours of painting and relaxing!"
Had s great time and the staff was very friendly and helpful... with that said be careful of your time 2 hours sounds like a long time but if you want to be detailed you might end up needing more time... with that said 10/10 would recommend
Excellent staff..... Covid precautions on point.... Fun times
"I am absolutely astounded by the experience my group and I have had! First off, I would go back regardless of what activities or products are available because of the amazing customer service I received. Thank you so much for giving my group extra time after hours to finish our ceramic painting! We were not pressured, were given all the time and products we needed - all with a SMILE!!! Way to go, guys ! Keep up the amazing work!"
Superb place!! They r so nice there. They have so many options.  Both pottery and painting classes.  I will definitely  come back!!!
Second time here. The staff is beyond nice. This a great family bonding experience. It's so relaxing. The pieces always come out fantastic. The process after you paint to the finish product is magnificent.
Such a great time we did a canvas painting playdate. It was super easy for the kids to trace the artwork and to paint. They had an awesome time.  Great prices.
Fun for all ages!
It's awesome!! Owners and staff are super nice and friendly üëç

"I‚Äôve had a great experience at All Sports PT. The Physical Therapists, the aids, the staff, everyone has been friendly and helpful. They listen to what I‚Äôm telling them and they ask lots of questions to find out the best way to help me recover. The exercises they‚Äôve taught me on my path to recovery will definitely help me in the gym once I‚Äôm back to full strength."
"Excellent staff.  They're all very knowledgable, and my injury is improving.  My only complaint is that it is impossible to cancel or reschedule via phone or online.  I called and waited for 20 minutes to just reschedule, and I got tired of waiting so I hung up without rescheduling.  The second time I tried i left a voice message, and never got a call back.  Online is a slight improvement."
"Everyone works hard to help whatever hurts. Only issue is that I never know which therapist will be there. There needs to be continuity. Also,  therapists should be able to take time off when sick."

"I needed a new hairdresser
I went to one and she had an epic fail with my color and highlights.

Julie got me right in, fixed my hair as much as she could and has me using some great new products. My hair is well on it way to recovery!!

I will recommend her salon to everyone!!"
"This is a beautiful, clean, and friendly salon. The hairdressers are very professional and talented. Brenda Kent worked a huge miracle when she fixed the most horrific damage and awful color another salon did to my hair. She worked her magic mixing and fixing. I cried everyday till she saved my hair and my spirits. Not only do I give this salon 5 stars but I recommend anyone who is looking for the real deal in hairdressers look no further and book an appointment. I'm going to post pictures of the extreme damage and horrific cut and color first then post her magic. Julie Delhi salon especially Brenda Kent I thank you ‚ù§"
Mary is my favorite hair dresser. She always gets my haircut down perfectly giving me a custom tailored look. Epic.
"I've followed my stylist of 15 years to this salon and, I must say, it's the friendliest, cleanest salon I've been to in long while. Conveniently located with flexible staff and hours!"
Can't say much about the place as I only use one hairstylist (is that the right term these days?) She always has me in and out quick.
Brenda is amazing! The salon atmosphere is great and the prices are very reasonable.

Very nice from the phone to my home. Problem wasn't something they could fix without a septic tank drain but good service.
These guys arrived 45 minutes after our frantic call. Within an hour everything was repaired and working better than ever. They knew their stuff and got it done. Polite and courteous!
Tony did an outstanding job for us. He was very thorough and did a great job explaining what he was doing and the different options we had to solve our problems. He worked many hours in difficult weather conditions to solve our drain problems. The quality was top notch and we recommend him highly.
"I chose this company because of their 5 star review on Google, and they did not disappoint. Phillip Ngo was the service technician that came and thoroughly explained the issue, what he could rectify immediately, and what future repairs he recommended. I'm very pleased with the service. The clogged drain is gone. We are planning on the future replacement of my laundry sink, and I do not feel like I was overcharged at all! I highly recommend Zoom Drain!"
"My experience working with Zoom Drain was absolutely fantastic. Anthony came out after hours (around 8pm) to address a back up in our duplex. He was very professional, and even educated me on exactly what the problem was, how he was going to fix it, and offered solutions to prevent issues down the road. I highly recommend Zoom Drain and Anthony specifically."
"I called zoom drain because I was having issues with my main drain. Tony and his apprentice Phil came over the same day to evaluate what had to be done. They got right to work, and brought out the snake and camera to see what was down my drain. They both worked together fighting my lines then realized there was a clog out front, 50‚Äù from the start point. They got right to digging to get to my plumbing, then tony got down and started cutting my pipe open, left to get the right parts needed to fix and , fixed my drain line. Also Phil and tony used their high pressure hose to clear the lines.

The next day they were back to clear my drain lines with the snake, then telling me I had another break, they told me a few days then tony and his guys went to my house to replace 14 feet of plumbing in my main drain, leaving me with new plumbing.

Tony and Phil are unbelievably respectful and smart. They worked as a team together to fix my issues with the upmost professionalism. If I had to use another company for a problem down the road I would without a doubt choose zoom drain."
"Great company, great people :-)"
"Two months ago I had a very difficult spine operation. When I got home from the hospital, I was I had shape. I couldn't lie down in my bed or get our of bed. Sitting or standing was practally impossible let alone getting out of a chair.
My daughter knew of a lady who works at United Oxygen and made arrangements to get me a reclining chair. I expressed that I needed one ASAP!
Well, United had one at my house the next day! Thank you Jackie!
You saved my life!"
Very knowledgeable and willing to work with doctors to get your prescription  approved
"I cannot begin to tell you how great the employees here are. From the very moment I walked in, they made me feel more like a friend that they were trying to help, as opposed to a patient, customer, or just another number. Staff is friendly and courteous, and goes the extra mile to make sure that what you are purchasing IS correct for you. Not once did I feel i was being rushed out the door, because they could not be bothered. I cant say the same about most of the medical supply companies that our local Hospitals and Health systems use."
"Want to breathe easy? This is the place to go.
Great customer service. My 02 supplier for a couple years."
First trip in 2 years since being ill. United and Ann made very thing so easy. No snags and a great trip
They truly care about the people they care for. If there ever is a problem they take care of right away.
Herb and I visited Royal Way and we met Dr. Igwe and she was a tremendous blessing. We learn so much from her in a short space of time and we will highly recommend Royal Way Healthy Food to everyone who is looking to step up in a healthier way of living. The drinks were delicious the food was fresh and it was simply awesome!  Looking forward to my next visit
I had the Tropical turmeric cleanser green smoothie and I felt the effect within hours and the drink is fresh and taste very delicious.
"Well, I'm speechless! I went into this store today and I was shocked but in a great blessing way! I met Mary the owner and she was very passionate about what she represents regarding your health. And I thank her for actually caring rather than being about the money cuz other companies are only interested in your money instead . Thank you Mary for the consultation.  I will definitely be back agin,count me in! I would recommend this place for everyone"
"Not only did I leave with one of the best juices ever I left with knowledge. Mrs. Royal way educated me as She fixed the tropical smoothie with coconut milk etc... she educated me in what every ingredient is good for, for your body for free. I will be back and have become a loyal customer."
I love this place.  Mary is knowledgeable and a beautiful person...

"Very good Mexican food for the price and the neighborhood. In addition, they have a wide variety of beers. However, they do not accept credit cards without chips."
"I can't speak on the food in this place, but I come here mostly for the gigantic glasses of margaritas and those are certainly pretty good. The cost/drink ratio is more than worth it on those."

"I was so happy with my son first appointment with Peds. Staff was friendly and awesome. The doctor was great, definitely happy with this place. I love how it was so clean and cared for your safety from covid."
I just went today because I thought my child had a cold.  We have been patients of the business for years now.  Anyone we have seen has always been acceptable.  But.  Today.  With concerns if course about corona...who knows?  But we had a great doctor who assured me my child had a Cold .   No.   A covid test nor  pulsox test was done.  But I'm fine with that because my child wasn't having a fever or breathing issues
"This place is absolutely great. Staff is awalys amiable and the doctors/nurse practitioners are extremely professional, and thorough. My favorite doctor to see is Dr. Iype. He always greats us with a friendly face, answers all my questions, spends sufficient time with my son and always has great bedside manners. Jennifer the lactation consultant was such a great help to me when I was having difficulty nursing  my son. Thanks to her knowledge and patience, I am now able to nurse him and I am so thankful I met with her. If you‚Äôre looking for a pediatric office this place is definitely a great choice!"
Doctors and staff are super nice and very accommodating.
I have been going here for years. Dr. Iype is a caring and compassionate about his patients. When I call when me children is sick always scheduling an appointment in a couple of hours. The receptionist is kind and concern about my children needs. Always attentive.

Amazing group that takes care of beautiful and sweet horses.
Free to go to and even gave us food to give to their horses. Not much else going on besides the horses but that's to be expected. Volunteers keep up the good work!
"Absolutely love coming by to see the horses. They're very sweet, and you can buy special treats to give them, they eat right out of your hand, and are so gentle. Any money given helps with saving these sweet animals, many who have been through some very bad experiences. Worth visiting, especially with little ones. <3"
"Love this place, wonderful people and with an amazing cause how can you not stop by and support these horses. I love how you can buy a bag a treats and feed the horses, which the volunteers help you with. Great for showing children the meaning of a rescue that is not just about cats and dogs."
"Great activity for kids, supports a great cause.  Entire staff beyond friendly"
Beautiful horse you can visit and pet. Peaceful place
Should be 10 star review. Awesome place and people. So cool to get to see such beautiful horses up close.
"We stumbled upon this place just wandering around. Didn't know what to expect and just went in and said hello. It's not an open attraction but the folks were happy to say hello and mentioned that they were waiting on a pot belly pig rescue to arrive, and within a few minutes of chatting sure enough piggy shows up. Our little Chihuahua Chuck didn't seem to appreciate piggy, but my wife loved to meet it!"

"Hi, Gail R. here on her husbands google share account .  This is one of the best dental places I have been to on so many levels.
I wasn't even their patient and had a dental problem over the weekend and they took me first thing today, this Monday morning.  The support staff was very nice and helpful, especially with the aspects of my insurance that I did not understand .
The Tech was very nice and professional, took my X-rays, always checking how I was doing as I was waiting for the dentist.
Meeting Dr. Zerbo was a pleasure, especially since I was so nervous and he was just so kind and compassionate.  He was very honest and forthcoming explaining my condition and I knew I am in good hands and  trust was established.
This is truly a great practice that treats patients with respect and dignity.
When I went to my pharmacy the medicine was there as promised.
I highly recommend this practice especially since they do periodontal and general dentistry among many other procedures so you won't have to run around to a different place for every little thing like I used to do.  Also because there are two Dr's on staff  if one is out, the other one can help you in an emergency  . This is important to me."
Awesome people. My teeth have never felt so clean. Would give more than 5 stars if I could.
"Love this place.
The staff listens to what you need instead dismissing how you are feeling. There is no wait time any time I have been there and they are quick and efficient during your appointment."
"super happy to find this place, excellent service"
I was not a Distinctive patient but needed to get a crown replaced. They got me in immediately on a Saturday and everyone was incredible! Now I see why my wife has raved about them! Dr. Zerbo and the entire staff were unbelievably nice and attentive. They explained every step and were totally transparent on costs. I already made an appointment to go back for a cleaning and check up! Great experience... they have earned a new patient and I will recommend them to everyone!
"A lovely staff which makes every effort to make sure clients are well taken care of in every way.  As  a first time patient with a minor emergency, they squeezed me into their  schedule and took great care of me with the utmost skill and friendliness. Dr. Soral is extremely kind and was very adept at responding to a very uncommon situation and making me comfortable again. He is really nice, too, and the entire staff is perfectly lovely. They are a really great  find."
"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  Service is always thorough, professional and kind.  Mrs. Mazer and Mary are always warm and welcoming.  They are very punctual, which I truly appreciate since it's become a lost virtue. Above all the work is great and the dentist is gentle and considerate. I would highly recommend them to everyone."
"Dr. Zerbo is the man! I've been seeing him for years and will never see another dentist! He's very gentle and has a calming way about him. Even if I'm nervous going in, he puts me at ease once I'm in the chair. He's worked on everything in my mouth from a root canal to cavities, to just checking in during regular cleanings. Highly recommend!"
"Always a pleasant experience, the staff is friendly and well versed, Dr Soral is knowledgeable and a genuinely kind person. I would highly recommend Distinctive Dentistry.Thank you to Amanda and Colleen for all your help today üòÄ"
"When calling  customer service one has to be patient!  I was able to speak to Susan Murphy who was very professional. They don't have an easy job.
Santiago and Edwin were also patient and helpful with me regarding questions. Just my opinion I think management has to hire more staff and locals maybe that will help with all these complaints!"
Been here and signed up - First impressions last and this place is spot on! I had tour with Shaun who really took time to give as many details as he could and show several floors of their location. I would absolutely recommend to everybody who needs space to work as they are extremely flexible especially nowadays!
average workspace. nothing special. but good enough that it doesn‚Äôt deserve lesser stars
Love this place very clean and calm

It was so nice to come see new people the women who introduced me was so sweet I'll be heading back this week.
This is a great place very caring staff and nurses. 2 or 3 of the kitchen staff have their favorite and have an attitude which I think sucks and that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5üåü's
You can socialize there meet people. They make you feel loved
The staff is very nice
Very good services
Respectful friendly environment

"Wonderful addition to the community! A wide variety of products, and the owner is very attentive to suggestions, and contributes amazingly to the Astoria community in myriad ways. The refill station is a godsend, it's become my go to place for home goods."
"Ditto to all the other reviews. Have been a few times, most recently to refill our dish soap. I am so happy my fianc√© and I found this place!"
"So glad to finally have a zero waste store in Astoria! Purchased some products for pickup a while back and everything has been great! My dish soap bar is still going strong after 2 months of use, and I especially love the coffee exfoliating bar soap."
"Kayli has curated a beautiful selection of home goods, skin and bodycare, and gifts to help you incorporate zero-waste essentials into your daily routines and to make eco-friendly living more accessible. She works with diverse and ethical makers and works to ensure that every product is high-quality, affordable, and truly lovely. I picked up a body scrub, toilet paper, and a face mask and I‚Äôll definitely be back for more!"

"Best mechanic i found in a long time.
Might have a wait list, but well worth getting it fixed right than half done by other shops."
TJ is a very knowledgeable and capable auto tech. He does quality work for a reasonable price.
"Great prices, a few times even no charge!

We have two vehicles. An SUV and a hybrid car. Tom, the owner, has worked on both. Brakes were done in both vehicles without issue and at a lower price than the dealer or other well know chain garages. One time I brought my vehicle in for AC work that another garage misdiagnosed. He fixed it and for a lower cost.
One time I brought in the SUV for a hesitation issue and it was given a tune-up to solve the issue. This didn't solve the problem but it needed a tune-up anyway. I chose to live with the issue until it develops in to something worse. Other than that we have had no issues or regrets coming here for repairs or service."
Best place to get your car fixed hands down  TJ is the best mechanic around
"Accurate, excellent diagnostics and an honest hard-working mechanic! One of the best in the business!"
"Tom has worked on our 97 work truck which is a large box truck. And has worked on our old Explorer. But he has completely rebuilt my 05 Chevy Tahoe. From a 3"" lift kit, new tires, New Cam upgrade, new lifters, rocker arms, push rods, headers and tuned it with Deiablo and so much more. The guy knows how to work on cars/trucks and his prices are fair. He is my families choice for all auto problems i can't handle on my own. #HighGearAuto #CentralSquare #TopMachanic"
"Was here for a wedding. Setting was beautiful and it was a great time. The house was pretty awesome, although a little bit creepy with some old folks lying around. And the barn was awesome also. A perfect venue"
I was here for a wedding. Absolutely beautiful
"This is a great spot for a party. We attended a wedding and it as lovely. They did a good job on getting it all organized and the party went off without a hitch.  It was beautiful and very lovely.

My only issue was the lack of ventilation in the venue. It was very hot and I know it was outside but even with all of the fans on the air wasn't moving and we roasted. If they can get this figured out it would be pretty perfect."
"It‚Äôs hard to know where to start with this review.

The hosts are remarkable. They answered too many questions to count about the venue and details, all incredibly promptly. We were allowed multiple planning trips to figure out setup and specifics. They were extremely helpful on the day of with helping people to park while still giving us space to ourselves. Nancy and Steve are both incredible and working with them was a true delight.

The venue itself is perfect. The barn is absolutely gorgeous. There are many wedding supplies left behind by former brides that you are allowed access to, all you could need in terms of tables and chairs is readily available, and the space is beautifully decorated with lights, branches, rustic touches, and tulle. After booking this venue, I elicited a lot of ‚Äúwow‚Äùs by showing photos of just the inside. Additionally, the separation of the two levels allowed us to have a cocktail hour and outdoor games before bringing guests upstairs for dinner (and then back downstairs to the dance room!) The house is the cherry on top of the cake. It is truly stunning inside and very fun to tour. On our wedding day, we had two separate sides of the second floor for the groomsmen and bridesmaids where we could get ready comfortably amidst a beautiful setting. The house also has real bathrooms, which is pretty important for a wedding in my opinion. Lastly, the house was a perfect location for our wedding photos. We took a ton of photos inside and in front of the house and our photographer was very excited about all of the opportunities. This venue is breathtaking.

This venue earns still more points for affordability. It fit perfectly within our very modest hotel budget, the recommended caterer was excellent AND affordable, and being able to bring in our own beverages saved us more yet.

The mission of the venue also adds to the appeal. I love that the venue is set up as a space and fundraiser to contribute to the community and really felt that mission as we spoke to the owners.

All in all, any degree of perfection we achieved on our wedding day was thanks to this remarkable venue and these remarkable people. Our day was unique and beautiful and we felt that we were able to make it exactly what we wanted due to the space and hosts. Thank you!"

"Always crowded for a reason, the best soup dumplings outside of Chinatown, little place right in Little Neck. Bring cash, no credit cards, and try the bubble tea üëç"
"One of the best places if you're looking for dumplings. Great taste, fast service, always busy, so there may be a bit of wait before you get seated. But at the end it's going to be with it. Also, add a bubble tea to your meal for even better experience. You'll thank me later."
I love the dumplings! The food was really good! Do try the meatballs! We went as a group and they were very helpful and prompt.
Fairly authentic Taiwanese food. Try the beef noodle soup or fried pork chop noodle soup. Little soup dumplings are good and par with Joe's Shanghai.
"soup dumpling is juicy, but can do better....don't feel the pork taste the day i went (wed)"
Best soup dumplings cold noodles and great service. Cash only
"Excellent Taiwanese food, it is cash only though"
Dumplings are amazing!
Yummy place!!
